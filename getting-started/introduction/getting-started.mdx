## Step-by-step process

To start using Tonder's solution, please follow the steps below:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up your account">
    <Note>
      The Tonder team will create a Sandbox account for you, where you can set up your organizational details and change your password.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect to providers">
    This step will walk you through the initial setup of connections.
    To integrate Tonder with payment providers, do the following:

    1. Navigate to the [Connections](../dashboard/connections) section of the dashboard.
    2. Select the payment provider you want to connect.
    3. Enter the respective payment provider Sandbox(test) API Keys.
    4. Click the **Connect** button.

    <Check>
      You can check if the connection is successful by going to the [**Your Connections**](../dashboard/connections#your-connections) section.
    </Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a payment link">

    To simulate a payment, you need to create a payment link inside the dashboard. To create a payment link, perform the following steps:

    1. Access the [Payment Links](../dashboard/payment-links) section of the dashboard.
    2. Click the **+Create** button on the top-right corner.
    3. Fill in the required fields. As this is a simulation, any data will suffice.
    4. Click the **Create new Link** button at the top of the screen.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Process your first payment">    
    
    With the payment link in hand you need to pay it using a test card. To execute the payment, you need to:

    1. Access the payment link.
    2. Select **Pay with Credit/debit card**.
    3. Use one of the following test cards:

    |                      Provider                           |             Card Number            |          Cardholder          |                 CVC                |                Date               |

    |                     **Openpay**                         |         2223000048400011           |           Any name           |          Any three digits          |          Any future date          |

  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate the payment">
    After executing the payment with one of the available test cards, you need to check if the payment was successful. You can do it by going to the [Transaction](../dashboard/transactions) section and clicking on the transaction to view the response from the payment provider.
