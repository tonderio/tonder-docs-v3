title: "Get a Session"
openapi: "GET /checkout/v1/sessions/{id}"

Retrieve the current state and details of a payment session. This is the recommended way to verify payment completion after a customer is redirected back to your site.

## Common Use Cases

* **Post-Payment Verification**: When a customer returns to your `success_url`, retrieve the session to confirm the payment was actually completed.
* **Reconciliation**: Check the status of sessions for orders that may have been abandoned or are in an unknown state.
* **Status Polling**: If you're not using webhooks, you can poll this endpoint to check for payment completion.

## Key Fields to Check

* **status**: The overall session state (`pending`, `completed`, `expired`, `cancelled`).
* **payment_id**: If present and status is `completed`, this is the ID of the successful payment transaction.
* **transaction_status**: The status of the actual payment transaction (e.g., `Success`, `Declined`).
