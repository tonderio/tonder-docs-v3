openapi: "GET /checkout/v1/payments/{payment_id}"
---

Retrieve detailed information about a specific payment transaction. This endpoint provides granular details about individual payment attempts, including payment method information and transaction timestamps.

## When to Use This vs. Get Session

* **Get Session**: Use when you want to check the overall status of a payment session (recommended for most cases).
* **Get Payment Transaction**: Use when you need detailed information about a specific payment attempt, such as card details, exact timestamps, or when troubleshooting a specific transaction.

## Getting the payment_id

The `payment_id` is returned in the session object after a successful payment:

1. Customer completes payment on the hosted checkout page.
2. Session status changes to `completed`.
3. The session's `payment_id` field is populated with the transaction ID.
4. You can then use this ID to retrieve detailed transaction information.

## What You'll Get

This endpoint returns comprehensive transaction details including:

* Payment method information (e.g., card brand and last 4 digits).
* Exact transaction timestamps.
* Associated session ID for cross-referencing.
* Customer information used for the payment.
