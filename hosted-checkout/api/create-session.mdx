title: "Create a Payment Session"
openapi: "POST /checkout/v1/sessions"
---

This is the main endpoint for initiating a Hosted Checkout payment. It creates a new payment session and returns a secure URL where your customer can complete their payment.

## How It Works

1. Your server calls this endpoint with payment details (amount, items, customer info).
2. Tonder creates a secure session and returns a checkout URL.
3. You redirect your customer to this URL.
4. Customer completes the payment on Tonder's hosted page.
5. Customer is redirected back to your `success_url` or `cancel_url`.

## Session Lifecycle

The session starts in `pending` status and transitions to `completed`, `expired`, or `cancelled` based on customer actions. See the [Status Reference](/hosted-checkout/reference/status-reference) for all possible status values.
