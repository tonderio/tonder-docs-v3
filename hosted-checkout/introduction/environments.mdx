Tonder provides two distinct environments for integration: Staging for development and testing, and Production for live transactions.

You will have separate API keys for each environment.

| Environment | Dashboard | API Base URL |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Staging | https://stage.tonder.io | https://api-stage.tonder.io |
| Production | https://dashboard.tonder.io | https://api.tonder.io |

<Warning>
Always use your Test API Keys with the Staging URLs and your Production API Keys with the Production URLs.
</Warning>

During development and testing, use the **Staging** environment to safely test your integration without processing real payments. Log in to the [Staging Dashboard](https://stage.tonder.io) to retrieve your test API keys and configure your settings. Point your application to the staging API base URL (`https://api-stage.tonder.io`) and use test card numbers to simulate payment scenarios.

Once your integration is complete and tested, switch to the **Production** environment for live transactions. Access the [Production Dashboard](https://dashboard.tonder.io) to get your production API keys, and update your application to use the production API base URL (`https://api.tonder.io`). Never use production keys in staging, or test keys in production, as this can lead to configuration issues and failed transactions.
