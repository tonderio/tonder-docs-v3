Tonder's Hosted Checkout is a secure, pre-built payment page that makes it easy to accept online payments. You redirect your customer to a Tonder-hosted URL, where they complete their payment. We handle the UI, security, and payment processing, and then redirect the customer back to your site.

## Benefits

Tonder's Hosted Checkout offers several advantages for your business:

* Get started quickly with a low-code integration that involves just one API call to create a payment session.
* Securely accept card payments without handling sensitive card data directly on your servers, as Tonder handles PCI DSS compliance.
* Adapt the checkout page to your brand by adding your logo and changing colors, button shapes, and more.
* Automatically support a variety of payment methods available to your business.

## High-Level Flow

The integration process consists of four main parts: session creation, user redirection, payment completion, and status confirmation.

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Initiates Payment">
    Your customer clicks "Pay Now" on your website, triggering your server to create a payment session via the Tonder API.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Redirect to Tonder">
    Tonder returns a secure URL that you use to redirect your customer to the Hosted Checkout page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Payment Verification">
    The customer enters their payment details on Tonder's secure checkout page, and the payment is verified with the acquiring bank or 3DS provider.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Payment Processing">
    Based on the verification result, Tonder processes the payment. If declined, the customer can retry with a different payment method.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Return to Your Site">
    Tonder redirects the customer back to your website with the transaction status, and you display a confirmation page indicating whether the payment was successful.
