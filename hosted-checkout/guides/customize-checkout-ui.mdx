You can customize the Hosted Checkout page to match your brand's look and feel. There are two ways to apply customization:

1. Set a default look for all your checkout sessions using the business configuration.
2. Override the default settings for a specific, individual session.

## Method 1: Set Default Business Configuration

This method updates the default UI settings for your entire business. These settings will apply to all new checkout sessions unless you override them.

Call the [Set Business Configuration](/hosted-checkout/api/set-business-config) endpoint with your logo URL and default ui_config settings. This example demonstrates how to set your default business configuration:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api-stage.tonder.io/checkout/v1/business/config' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "logo_url": "https://your-cdn.com/logo-dark.png",
    "ui_config": {
      "branding": {
        "brand_color": "#FF5733",
        "brand_color_text": "#FFFFFF"
      },
      "theme": {
        "shapes": "rounded"
      }
    }
  }'
```

The API will return the saved configuration:

```json
{
  "logo_url": "https://your-cdn.com/logo-dark.png",
  "ui_config": {
    "branding": {
      "brand_color": "#FF5733",
      "brand_color_text": "#FFFFFF"
    },
    "theme": {
      "shapes": "rounded"
    }
  }
}
```

Now, all subsequent checkout sessions will use this configuration.

## Method 2: Override UI for a Specific Session

You can override any default setting for a single payment by passing a ui_config object when you [create a payment session](https://www.google.com/search?q=/hosted-checkout/guides/create-payment-session).

This is useful for co-branding, running promotions, or if you operate multiple storefronts under one Tonder account.

When calling the [Create a Payment Session](/hosted-checkout/api/create-session) endpoint, include the `ui_config` object in your request. This example shows how to create a session with custom UI settings for a promotional campaign:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api-stage.tonder.io/checkout/v1/sessions' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "external_id": "PROMO-XYZ-456",
    "amount": 1000,
    "currency": "MXN",
    "line_items": [
      {
        "name": "Promo Item",
        "quantity": 1,
        "unit_price": 1000
      }
    ],
    "customer": {
      "name": "Test Customer",
      "email": "test@example.com"
    },
    "urls": {
      "success_url": "https://your-store.com/checkout/success",
      "cancel_url": "https://your-store.com/checkout/cancel"
    },
    "ui_config": {
      "branding": {
        "brand_color": "#33CFFF"
      },
      "labels": {
        "submit_button": "Pay Now (Promo)"
      }
    }
  }'
```

This session will use the `#33CFFF` brand color and the custom button text, ignoring the default business config for those fields.
