When integrating Tonder Hosted Checkout, you will encounter three different IDs. Understanding the purpose of each is essential for a smooth integration and for reconciliation.

### id (Session ID)

The Session ID uses the format sess_... and is the unique identifier for the Checkout Session itself. A session is the container for the entire payment experience, from the moment you create it to when it's completed or expires.

You use the Session ID in the following ways:

* In the checkout URL Tonder provides, such as https://checkout.tonder.io/session/{id}.
* When calling the [Get a Session](/hosted-checkout/api/get-session) endpoint to check the session's status.
* It's returned in the success_url query parameters.

### payment_id (Payment Transaction ID)

The Payment Transaction ID uses the format pay_... and is the unique identifier for a single Payment Transaction. A transaction is a specific payment attempt, such as a card charge.

A single session, such as sess_123, might have multiple payment attempts if the first card is declined. For example:

* pay_abc (Attempt 1: Declined)
* pay_xyz (Attempt 2: Success)

You can find the Payment ID in the following locations:

* In the Session object (GET /sessions/{id}) once a payment is successful.
* In webhook payloads, such as session.completed and payment.transaction.

You use the Payment ID when calling the [Get a Payment Transaction](/hosted-checkout/api/get-payment) endpoint to get details of a specific charge.

### external_id (External ID)

The External ID is a user-defined string, such as ORD-12345. This is your internal identifier for the order, and you provide this ID when you create the payment session.

You use the External ID in the following ways:

* You send it in the [Create a Payment Session](/hosted-checkout/api/create-session) request.
* You use it to reconcile Tonder records with your own database.
* It's searchable in the [Tonder Dashboard](https://app.tonder.io).

### How They Relate

The diagram below shows how your system's order ID (external_id) maps to a Tonder Session, which can have multiple payment attempts:

```
Your System           Tonder's System
+-------------+       +-------------------------+
| Order       |  1:1  | Session (sess_...)      |
| (external_id)|------>| (external_id)           |
+-------------+       |                         |
                      |   1:N                   |
                      |   +-------------------+ |
                      |   | Payment (pay_...) | |
                      |   +-------------------+ |
                      |   | Payment (pay_...) | |
                      |   +-------------------+ |
                      +-------------------------+
```

Here's a typical payment flow:

1. You create an Order, such as ORD-500, in your system.
2. You create a Session (sess_abc) and pass external_id: "ORD-500".
3. The user tries to pay and Tonder creates a Payment (pay_123).
4. The payment is declined.
5. The user tries again with a different card and Tonder creates a new Payment (pay_456).
6. This payment succeeds.
7. The Session sess_abc is now marked completed and stores payment_id: "pay_456" as the successful transaction.
