This page provides the definitions for the two types of statuses used in the Hosted Checkout: Session Status and Payment Transaction Status.

## Understanding Session vs. Transaction Status

A common point of confusion is the difference between the `status` of a Session and the `status` of a Payment Transaction. They represent two different things:

**Session Status** represents the entire checkout experience you create for your customer. Think of it as the "shopping cart" or "order" that is waiting to be paid. A session's lifecycle is simple: it starts as `pending`, and can only end as `completed` (paid) or `expired` (abandoned).

**Transaction Status** represents a single attempt to pay for that session. A customer might have multiple transactions within one session if their first attempt fails. A transaction's status can be `Pending`, `Success`, `Declined`, or `Expired`.

The table below summarizes the key distinction:

| Type | Purpose | Example Values |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Session Status | Tells you the state of the order (Is it paid for?) | `pending`, `completed`, `expired` |
| Transaction Status | Tells you the state of a specific payment attempt (Did this charge go through?) | `Pending`, `Success`, `Declined`, `Expired` |

<Note>
For order fulfillment, you should almost always rely on the Session Status. Only listen for `session.status: "completed"` (via webhook or polling) to confirm an order is ready to be shipped.
</Note>

## Session Status

The status field on the Session object (sess_...) represents the overall state of the Hosted Checkout session. The table below describes all possible session status values:

| Status | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| pending | The session has been created, but the customer has not completed the payment. The URL is active. |
| completed | The customer has successfully completed the payment. This is a final state. |
| expired | The session was not completed within the allowed time (e.g., customer abandoned the page) and can no longer be paid. This is a final state. |

## Payment Transaction Status

The transaction_status field (on the Session object) or status (on the Payment object) represents the state of a specific payment attempt. The table below describes all possible transaction status values:

| Status | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| Pending | The payment has been initiated but is not yet confirmed (e.g., awaiting 3D Secure authentication). |
| Success | The payment was successfully authorized and processed. |
| Declined | The payment was declined by the card issuer or payment processor. The customer may be able to retry. |
| Expired | The payment attempt was not completed in time (e.g., user failed 3D Secure). |
