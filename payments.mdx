<Accordion title="Payment lifecycle">
    A payment cycle refers to the series of events that occur from the initiation of
    a payment transaction to its completion, including payment authorization,
    processing, settlement, and reconciliation.

    It is the sequence of steps necessary to move funds from the payer's account to
    the payee's account. A typical payment lifecycle can be divided into the
    following stages:

    |                 |                                                                                                                                                                                        |
    | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `Authorization` | The payer's bank or payment service provider verifies the availability of funds in the payer's account and authorizes the payment.                                                     |
    | `Processing`    | The payment is transmitted via the payment network to the payee's bank or payment service provider. Settlement: Funds are transferred from the payer's account to the payee's account. |
    | `Conciliation`  | The transaction is reconciled and recorded on the payer's and payee's account statements.                                                                                              |

    Each stage of the payment lifecycle involves various activities, such as
    validating payment information, exchanging information with various parties, and
    updating the accounts involved.

    The payment lifecycle can vary in length and complexity based on factors such as
    the payment method used, the payment network involved, and any regulatory
    requirements. A well-designed, efficient payment lifecycle can help ensure the
    accuracy and security of payments and can help improve the overall customer
    experience.
