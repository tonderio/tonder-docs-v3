A dispute occurs when a customer raises a concern with their card issuer regarding a payment made through a particular platform. 

Using Tonder's payment processing capabilities, you can handle disputes in a secure manner directly from our Dashboard. This page aims to guide you through handling your disputes in Tonder.

## How disputes work

If a customer raises concerns or questions regarding a payment made through Tonder with their card issuer, it leads to a dispute. This, in turn, triggers a formal process on the card network, resulting in the immediate reversal of the payment. As a result, the payment amount, as well as any associated dispute fees, are first deducted from Tonder, and then from your account balance. Below is an overview of the steps involved in a dispute process:

**STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE OF THE DASHBOARD PROCESS NEEDS TO BE ADDED HERE**

- Accept: Accepting a dispute involves acknowledging the cardholder's claim as valid and agreeing to the chargeback without contesting it further.

- Dispute: Disputing a transaction refers to the process of providing evidence to the card issuer to challenge and overturn a cardholder's claim against a payment.

  Tonder's dispute module functions primarily as an informational tool for all other Payment Service Providers (PSPs). Manage dispute operations directly through the respective admin panel for other payment processors.

### Disputes fees

The fees that apply to disputes for your business will be defined in the contract with our commercial team. Whenever a cardholder initiates a dispute, these fees will be deducted from your reserves. It is crucial to be aware of these charges and factor them into your financial planning.

## Navigating timing constraints

Cardholders can initiate disputes up to 120 days from the original transaction date. However, certain circumstances might warrant an extension of this timeframe as per specific regulations.

To ensure a prompt response, it is recommended to analyze the issue immediately and submit a dispute request within 10 calendar days of receiving it. Relevant documentation should be attached with the request to challenge disputes. After providing evidence in response to a dispute, the issuing bank is given a specific period, typically ranging from 60 to 75 days based on the card network, to evaluate the evidence and decide on the resolution.

<Note>
  The entire dispute process typically takes 2-3 months from initiation to resolution, and unfortunately, there are no ways businesses can expedite the process.
