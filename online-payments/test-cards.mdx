title: "Test Cards"
'og:description': "This page provides a list of test cards for use along with their 3-D Secure results and transaction outcomes. Use these test cards for simulating various payment scenarios when testing your integration with Tonder."

Use these test cards to simulate payment scenarios in the Stage environment before going live. All cards work exclusively in `https://stage.tonder.io` — they will not work in production.


<Tip>
  For a better experience, we recommend getting in touch with your Tonder representative to obtain test cards specific to your integration and region.
