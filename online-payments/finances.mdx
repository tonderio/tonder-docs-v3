The Finances module in Tonder serves as a crucial component for managing the financial aspects of your business. Understanding the fundamental concepts behind finances is essential for effectively navigating this module and ensuring the financial health of your operations. This page aims to provide a conceptual overview of finances and how they relate to Tonder.

## Understanding Financial Concepts

Tonder presents two basic financial concepts to help you keep track of your money in our platform:

### Balances

A balance represents the amount of money in your account at a given time. Balances can be categorized into various types, each serving a different purpose:

- **In Transit**: Funds that are on their way to your bank account but are not yet available for use.
- **Pending**: Funds that have not yet been cleared or made available for disbursement.
- **In Reserve**: Funds held by Tonder to cover potential risks and liabilities associated with your transactions.

### Settlements

A settlement is the process of transferring funds from Tonder to your bank account. This involves aggregating all transactions over a period and disbursing the net amount after accounting for any fees, refunds, or adjustments:

- **Fees**: Costs associated with processing transactions, including charges for payment processing, refunds, and other services.
- **Refunds**: Amounts returned to customers for various reasons, such as returns or cancellations, which are deducted from your account balance.
- **Adjustments**: Corrections or changes made to your account balance, which can include refunds, chargebacks, and other financial activities.
