The Lite Checkout gives you core payment functionality while you build the UI.

## Prerequisites

-   You have successfully [installed the Tonder JS SDK](/sdk-integration/web/js-lite/installation).
-   You have built your own custom HTML form for collecting card details.

## Steps

### 1. Initialize the Lite SDK

Create an instance of `LiteCheckout`. Even though you are building a custom UI, you must still call `injectCheckout()` to initialize the SDK's hidden logic.

```javascript
import { LiteCheckout } from "tonder-web-sdk";

const liteCheckout = new LiteCheckout({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  returnUrl: "[https://your-website.com/return](https://your-website.com/return)",
  mode: 'development',
});

// This is required to initialize the SDK's underlying services
liteCheckout.injectCheckout();
```

2. Build Your Custom Form
Create your own HTML form for card number, expiration date, CVV, and cardholder name. Use the SDK's validation helpers to provide real-time feedback to the user.

3. Call the Payment Method
In your payment button's event listener, collect the card data from your custom form and include it in the payment() method's payload.

```javascript

document.getElementById('custom-pay-button').addEventListener('click', async (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();

  const cardData = {
    card_number: document.getElementById('card-number').value,
    cardholder_name: document.getElementById('card-name').value,
    expiration_month: document.getElementById('exp-month').value,
    expiration_year: document.getElementById('exp-year').value,
    cvv: document.getElementById('cvv').value,
  };

  const checkoutData = {
    customer: { firstName: "Juan", email: "juan.hernandez@mail.com" },
    currency: 'mxn',
    cart: { total: 399, items: [{ name: "T-Shirt", amount_total: 399 }] },
    card: cardData
  };

  try {
    const response = await liteCheckout.payment(checkoutData);
    alert('Payment successful!');
  } catch (error) {
    alert('Payment failed.');
  }
});
```
