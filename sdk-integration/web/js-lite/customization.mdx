The Tonder JS Lite SDK is designed for maximum customization by allowing you to build your own user interface.

---

## UI and Styling

Unlike the [Inline SDK](/sdk-integration/web/js-inline/customization), the Lite SDK does not render any visible UI components. This means you have complete control over the look and feel of your payment form.

You are responsible for:
-   Creating all HTML input elements (`<input>`, `<select>`) for card details.
-   Styling these elements using your own CSS or design system.
-   Arranging the layout of the form on your page.

## Functional Customization

While you build the UI, the Lite SDK provides essential backend functionality and helpers:

-   **Payment Processing**: The `payment()` method securely handles the transaction.
-   **Card Enrollment**: The `saveCustomerCard()` method tokenizes and saves card data.
-   **Client-Side Validation**: You can use the exported [validation helper functions](/sdk-integration/web/js-lite/methods#validation-helper-functions) (e.g., `validateCardNumber`, `validateCVV`) to provide real-time feedback to your users, ensuring data is in the correct format before it's sent to Tonder.

By combining your custom-built UI with the SDK's core methods, you can create a fully branded and secure checkout experience.
