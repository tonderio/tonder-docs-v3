description: "How to securely save a customer's card on your website using the JS Lite SDK."
---

You can securely save customer card details for future purchases using the **Lite version** of the Tonder JS SDK. This process tokenizes the card information, so you avoid the security risks and PCI compliance burden of storing sensitive data.

---

## Prerequisites

-   You are using the [Lite Checkout](/sdk-integration/web/js-lite/make-a-payment) version of the JS SDK.
-   Your backend is set up to provide a [Secure Token](/sdk-integration/web/js-lite/make-a-payment) required for card management.
-   You have initialized the `LiteCheckout` SDK instance.

<Warning>
You must use a **Secure Token** to manage cards with the Tonder SDK. This token provides temporary, restricted access to card vaulting functions and should be generated on your server to protect your secret API key.
</Warning>

---

## Steps

### 1. Configure the SDK with a Secure Token

When you initialize the `LiteCheckout` instance, you must configure it with the customer's email and the secure token you obtained from your backend.

```javascript
const liteCheckout = new LiteCheckout({ apiKey: "YOUR_PUBLIC_API_KEY" });

liteCheckout.configureCheckout({
  customer: { email: "customer@example.com" },
  secureToken: "SECURE_TOKEN_FROM_YOUR_BACKEND"
});

liteCheckout.injectCheckout();
```

### 2. Save a Customer Card

Use the saveCustomerCard method to tokenize and save the card details. This method takes an object containing the raw card information collected from your custom UI.

```javascript

const handleSaveCard = async () => {
  try {
    const cardData = {
      card_number: "4111111111111111",
      cvv: "123",
      expiration_month: "12",
      expiration_year: "25",
      cardholder_name: "John Doe",
    };

    const response = await liteCheckout.saveCustomerCard(cardData);
    console.log("Card saved successfully:", response);
    // The response will contain a unique identifier (skyflow_id) for the saved card.
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error saving card:", error);
  }
};
```

3. Retrieve and Manage Saved Cards
Once cards are saved, you can retrieve them using getCustomerCards() and delete them using removeCustomerCard(cardId).
