Tonder provides two JavaScript SDKs for web applications, each designed for different use cases and integration approaches.


## SDK Versions

Each web SDK serves a specific purpose in the payment integration workflow. Below you'll find detailed information about each SDK, including their best use cases, features, and practical implementation guidance.

### JS Full SDK

The JS Inline SDK is ideal for teams who want a quick, secure integration with minimal development effort. It provides a complete, pre-built payment interface that handles all the complex payment logic for you. It's best for:

The main features of the JS Inline SDK are:

| Feature | Description |
