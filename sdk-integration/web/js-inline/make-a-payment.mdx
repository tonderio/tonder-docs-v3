This guide covers how to process a payment using the **Inline Checkout** version of the Tonder JS SDK.

<Info>
The **JS Inline SDK** is designed for quick, single-transaction payments and does not directly expose methods for enrolling or managing saved cards. Its primary purpose is to provide a complete, out-of-the-box checkout UI.

To securely save and manage customer payment methods, you must use the **[JS Lite SDK](/sdk-integration/web/js-lite/enroll-payment-method)**, which provides the necessary methods and requires a custom UI.
</Info>


## Prerequisites

-   You have successfully [installed the Tonder JS SDK](/sdk-integration/web/js-inline/installation).
-   You have a checkout page on your website with an empty `div` and a button.

```html
<div id="tonder-checkout"></div>
<button id="pay-button">Pay Now</button>
```

## Steps

1. Initialize the SDK
Create a new instance of InlineCheckout, providing your API key and return URL.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript npm package option
import { InlineCheckout } from "tonder-web-sdk";

const inlineCheckout = new InlineCheckout({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  returnUrl: 'https://your-website.com/return',
  mode: 'development',
});
```

```javascript script tag option
const inlineCheckout = new TonderSdk.InlineCheckout({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  returnUrl: 'https://your-website.com/return',
  mode: 'development',
});
```

</CodeGroup>

2. Inject the Checkout UI
Call injectCheckout() to render the pre-built payment form inside the div with the tonder-checkout ID.

```javascript

inlineCheckout.injectCheckout();
```
3. Add a Payment Button
Add an event listener to your payment button. When clicked, it should call the payment() method with the customer and cart data.

```javascript
document.getElementById('pay-button').addEventListener('click', async () => {
  const checkoutData = {
    customer: { firstName: "Juan", email: "juan.hernandez@mail.com" },
    currency: 'mxn',
    cart: { total: 399, items: [{ name: "T-Shirt", amount_total: 399 }] }
  };
  try {
    const response = await inlineCheckout.payment(checkoutData);
    alert('Payment successful!');
  } catch (error) {
    alert('Payment failed.');
  }
});
```

4. Handle 3DS Verification

After a 3DS challenge, the user is redirected back to your returnUrl. Call verify3dsTransaction() on this page to get the final status of the payment.

```javascript

// On your return page
inlineCheckout.verify3dsTransaction().then(response => {
  if (response.transaction_status === 'Success') {
    alert('3DS Transaction successful!');
  }
});
```
