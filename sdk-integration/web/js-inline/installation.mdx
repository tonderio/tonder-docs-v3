This guide provides the installation steps for Tonder's JavaScript Inline SDK.

---

## Requirements

The Tonder JS SDK relies on third-party scripts for PCI DSS compliance and connecting to payment processors. You must include these scripts in your HTML file for the SDK to function correctly.

Add the following script tags to the `<head>` of your HTML file:

```html title="index.html"
<head>
  ...
  <script src="[https://js.skyflow.com/v1/index.js](https://js.skyflow.com/v1/index.js)"></script>
  <script src="[https://openpay.s3.amazonaws.com/openpay.v1.min.js](https://openpay.s3.amazonaws.com/openpay.v1.min.js)"></script>
  <script src="[https://openpay.s3.amazonaws.com/openpay-data.v1.min.js](https://openpay.s3.amazonaws.com/openpay-data.v1.min.js)"></script>
  ...
</head>

```

## Installation

You can add the Tonder JS SDK to your project either by using the npm package or by including a script tag directly in your HTML file.

<Accordion title="NPM Package">
For projects using a package manager like npm or yarn, run the following command:

To use the SDK without a package manager, add the following script tag to your HTML file, preferably before the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag.

```html
<script src="[https://zplit-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/v1/bundle.min.js](https://zplit-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/v1/bundle.min.js)"></script>
