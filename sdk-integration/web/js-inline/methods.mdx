This page provides a comprehensive reference for the core methods available in the `InlineCheckout` class. Whether you're implementing basic payment processing or advanced checkout functionality, this documentation will help you understand the available methods and their usage.

## Method Details

Each method in the Tonder JS Inline SDK serves a specific purpose in the payment integration workflow. Below you'll find detailed information about each method, including their parameters, usage examples, and practical implementation guidance.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="new InlineCheckout(config)">

Creates and initialises a new SDK instance with your API credentials and configuration options.

The constructor accepts the following configuration parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `apiKey` | string | Yes | Your Tonder API key for authentication |
| `returnUrl` | string | Yes | URL where users will be redirected after 3D Secure verification |
| `mode` | string | Yes | Environment mode: `'development'` or `'production'` |
| `styles` | object | No | Custom styling options for the checkout UI |
| `labels` | object | No | Custom text for input labels |
| `placeholders` | object | No | Custom placeholder text for input fields |

Here's how to initialise the SDK with basic configuration:

```javascript
import { InlineCheckout } from "tonder-web-sdk";

const inlineCheckout = new InlineCheckout({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  returnUrl: 'https://your-website.com/return',
  mode: 'development',
  styles: {
    inputStyles: {
      base: { border: "1px solid #E0E0E0", padding: "12px 10px" }
    }
  }
});
```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="injectCheckout()">

Renders the pre-built checkout interface within your designated container div. This method creates and displays the complete payment form with card input fields, validation, and styling.

This method doesn't require any parameters. Simply call it to render the checkout interface:

```javascript
inlineCheckout.injectCheckout();
```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="payment(paymentData)">

Initiates a payment transaction using the provided customer and cart data. This method processes the payment and handles the secure transaction flow.

The payment method expects a data object with the following structure:

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `paymentData` | object | Yes | Payment information including customer and cart details |
| `paymentData.customer` | object | Yes | Customer information (firstName, email, etc.) |
| `paymentData.cart` | object | Yes | Cart information (total, items) |
| `paymentData.currency` | string | Yes | Currency code (e.g., 'mxn') |

Here's a complete example of processing a payment:

```javascript
const checkoutData = {
  customer: { 
    firstName: "Juan", 
    email: "juan.hernandez@mail.com" 
  },
  currency: 'mxn',
  cart: { 
    total: 399, 
    items: [{ name: "T-Shirt", amount_total: 399 }] 
  }
};

try {
  const response = await inlineCheckout.payment(checkoutData);
  console.log('Payment successful:', response);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Payment failed:', error);
}
```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="verify3dsTransaction()">

Verifies the status of a 3D Secure transaction after the user is redirected back to your site. This method should be called on your return page to get the final transaction status.

This method doesn't require any parameters and should be called on your return page after 3D Secure verification:

```javascript
// On your return page
inlineCheckout.verify3dsTransaction().then(response => {
  if (response.transaction_status === 'Success') {
    alert('3DS Transaction successful!');
  } else {
    alert('3DS Transaction failed');
  }
});
```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="removeCheckout()">

Cleans up the SDK instance and removes UI components from the DOM. Use this method when you need to destroy the checkout interface.

This method doesn't require any parameters and can be called whenever you need to clean up the checkout interface:

```javascript
inlineCheckout.removeCheckout();
```

  </Accordion>
