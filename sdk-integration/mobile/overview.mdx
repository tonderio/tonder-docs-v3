## SDK Versions

Each mobile SDK comes in two versions to suit different development needs:

### Full SDK (Inline)

The Full SDK is ideal for teams who want a quick, secure integration with minimal development effort. It provides a complete, pre-built payment interface that handles all the complex payment logic for you. It's best for:

- Quick integration and prototyping
- Standard payment flows
- Teams new to mobile payment integration
- Projects with tight deadlines

The main features of the Full SDK are:

| Feature | Description |

| 3DS Support | Automatic handling of 3D Secure authentication challenges |
| PCI Compliance | Secure data handling without sensitive data touching your servers |

### Lite SDK

The Lite SDK gives you complete control over the payment experience while handling the secure payment processing behind the scenes. Perfect for applications with existing design systems or custom UI requirements. It's best for:

- Custom payment UI designs
- Complex payment workflows
- Existing design systems
- Advanced payment method management

The main features of the Lite SDK are:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
