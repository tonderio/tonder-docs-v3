This guide provides the installation and configuration steps for Tonder's React Native Lite SDK.

## Prerequisites

Before installing the Tonder React Native Lite SDK, ensure your project meets the minimum requirements for compatibility and functionality. The SDK requires specific versions of React Native and related dependencies to work properly.

### Step 1: Verify Project Requirements

Ensure your project meets the following requirements:

- react-native >= 0.70
- react >= 16.8
- react-native-svg >= 15.0.0
- react-native-webview >= 13.6.0

<Warning>
The SDK will not work with older versions of these packages.
</Warning>

## Installation

To install the Tonder React Native SDK, you need to add the package to your project. The Lite SDK provides individual secure components that allow you to build completely custom payment interfaces while maintaining PCI compliance.

### Step 1: Install the SDK Package

Install the SDK package from npm:

```bash
npm install @tonder.io/rn-sdk
# OR
yarn add @tonder.io/rn-sdk
```

<Note>The React Native SDK uses a single package with different modes. For the Lite SDK experience, you'll configure it with `SDKType.LITE` and use individual secure input components.</Note>
