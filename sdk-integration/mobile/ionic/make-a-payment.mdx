This guide walks you through processing a payment using the **Full SDK** (`InlineCheckout`) for Ionic. You'll learn how to initialize the SDK, configure payment data, display the checkout interface, and handle the complete payment flow including 3D Secure verification.

## Prerequisites

Before you can process payments with the Tonder Ionic SDK, ensure you have completed the necessary setup and have the required components in place.

- You have successfully [installed and configured](/sdk-integration/mobile/ionic/installation) the Tonder Ionic SDK.
- You have a checkout page with an empty `div` element to contain the SDK's UI.

```html
<div id="tonder-checkout"></div>
<button id="pay-button">Pay Now</button>
```

## Payment Integration Steps

Follow these steps to integrate payment processing into your Ionic application. This process involves initializing the SDK, configuring payment data, displaying the checkout interface, and processing the transaction.

### Step 1: Initialize the SDK

Create an instance of the `InlineCheckout` class to establish a secure connection with Tonder's payment services. This initialization configures the SDK with your API credentials and sets up the operating mode for your environment.

```javascript
import { InlineCheckout } from "@tonder.io/ionic-full-sdk";

const inlineCheckout = new InlineCheckout({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  returnUrl: "YOUR_RETURN_URL",
  mode: "stage", // or "production"
});
```

### Step 2: Inject the Checkout UI

Render the pre-built checkout interface within your designated container. The `injectCheckout()` method creates and displays the complete payment form with card input fields, validation, and styling.

```javascript
inlineCheckout.injectCheckout();
```

### Step 3: Process the Payment

Configure the payment processing by adding an event listener to your payment button. When clicked, the SDK will collect the payment data and initiate the secure transaction process.

```javascript
document.getElementById('your-pay-button').addEventListener('click', async () => {
  const paymentData = {
    customer: { firstName: "Juan", email: "juan.hernandez@mail.com", /* ... */ },
    cart: { total: 399, items: [ /* ... */ ] },
    currency: "mxn"
  };

  try {
    const response = await inlineCheckout.payment(paymentData);
    console.log('Payment successful:', response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Payment failed:', error);
  }
});
```

### Step 4: Handle 3DS Verification

If a 3D Secure challenge is required, the SDK will automatically handle the redirection process. After the user returns to your returnUrl, call `verify3dsTransaction()` to get the final transaction status.

```javascript
// On your return page
inlineCheckout.verify3dsTransaction().then(response => {
  if (response.transaction_status === 'Success') {
    alert('3DS Transaction verified.');
  } else {
    alert('3DS Transaction Failed');
  }
});
```
