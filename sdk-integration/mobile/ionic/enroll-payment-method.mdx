This guide shows you how to enroll and manage payment methods using the Ionic Lite SDK. You'll learn how to configure the SDK for card management, save customer cards securely, and retrieve saved payment methods.

<Note>
Card enrollment and management features are available in the Lite version (`@tonder.io/ionic-lite-sdk`) of the Ionic SDK. This allows you to build a custom UI for saving cards.

## Prerequisites

Before you can enroll payment methods with the Tonder Ionic SDK, ensure you have completed the necessary setup and have the required components in place.

- You are using the `LiteCheckout` from the `@tonder.io/ionic-lite-sdk` package.
- Your backend is set up to provide a [Secure Token](/sdk-integration/web/js-lite/make-a-payment) for card management.

## Payment Method Enrollment Steps

Follow these steps to implement payment method enrollment in your Ionic application. This process involves configuring the SDK with secure tokens, collecting card data through your custom UI, and securely saving the payment method for future use.

### Step 1: Configure the SDK with a Secure Token

Initialize the `LiteCheckout` instance and configure it with the customer's email and the secure token obtained from your backend. This configuration enables secure card management operations.

```javascript
import { LiteCheckout } from "@tonder.io/ionic-lite-sdk";

const liteCheckout = new LiteCheckout({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });

liteCheckout.configureCheckout({
  customer: { email: "customer@example.com" },
  secureToken: "SECURE_TOKEN_FROM_YOUR_BACKEND"
});
```

### Step 2: Save a Customer Card

Use the `saveCustomerCard` method to tokenize and save the card details collected from your custom UI. This method securely processes the card information and stores it for future transactions.

```javascript
const handleSaveCard = async () => {
  try {
    const cardData = {
      card_number: "4111111111111111",
      cvv: "123",
      expiration_month: "12",
      expiration_year: "25",
      cardholder_name: "John Doe",
    };

    const response = await liteCheckout.saveCustomerCard(cardData);
    console.log("Card saved successfully:", response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error saving card:", error);
  }
};
```

### Step 3: Retrieve Saved Cards

Use the `getCustomerCards` method to retrieve all saved payment methods for the configured customer. This allows you to display saved cards in your custom UI.

```javascript
const loadSavedCards = async () => {
  try {
    const cards = await liteCheckout.getCustomerCards();
    console.log("Saved cards:", cards);
    // Display cards in your custom UI
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error loading cards:", error);
  }
};
```

### Step 4: Remove a Saved Card

Use the `removeCustomerCard` method to delete a previously saved card using its unique ID. This provides customers with control over their saved payment methods.

```javascript
const removeCard = async (cardId) => {
  try {
    await liteCheckout.removeCustomerCard(cardId);
    console.log("Card removed successfully");
    // Refresh your card list
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error removing card:", error);
  }
};
```
