This guide provides the installation and configuration steps for Tonder's Ionic SDKs.

## Prerequisites

You must add the Openpay script tags to your main `index.html` file. These are required for PCI DSS compliance and for the SDK to reliably connect to the payment processor.

```html title="index.html"
<head>
  ...
  <script src="[https://openpay.s3.amazonaws.com/openpay.v1.min.js](https://openpay.s3.amazonaws.com/openpay.v1.min.js)"></script>
  <script src="[https://openpay.s3.amazonaws.com/openpay-data.v1.min.js](https://openpay.s3.amazonaws.com/openpay-data.v1.min.js)"></script>
  ...
</head>
```

## Installation

Tonder provides two SDK packages for Ionic, depending on your needs.

- @tonder.io/ionic-full-sdk: Provides a complete, pre-built checkout UI (Inline Checkout).

- @tonder.io/ionic-lite-sdk: Provides core payment functionality, allowing you to build your own custom UI.

Install the required package(s) using your preferred package manager.
