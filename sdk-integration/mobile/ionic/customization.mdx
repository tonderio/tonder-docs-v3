This guide covers how to customise the Tonder Ionic SDK to match your application's design and user experience requirements. Whether you're looking to integrate Tonder's payment processing into your existing UI or create a completely custom payment flow, this documentation will help you understand your options and implementation approaches.

<Warning>
The Full SDK (`@tonder.io/ionic-full-sdk`) does not support customization. For custom UI and styling, you must use the Lite SDK (`@tonder.io/ionic-lite-sdk`).
</Warning>

The Lite SDK is designed for maximum flexibility and complete UI control. It provides the core, secure logic for payment processing without rendering any visible UI, allowing you to build a completely custom payment experience.

- Build your own payment form using standard Ionic components.
- Apply your application's existing design system and styles.
- Control the layout, flow, and interactions completely.
- All payment logic remains secure and PCI-compliant.

### Implementation Approach

To implement the Lite SDK, you will create your own input fields and then pass the collected data to the SDK's payment methods.

Here's a simple example showing how to use the Lite SDK with custom UI. This code creates a custom payment widget that collects user input through Ionic's standard components and then uses the SDK's documented methods to process the payment data:

```javascript
import { LiteCheckout } from "@tonder.io/ionic-lite-sdk";

class CustomPaymentPage {
  constructor() {
    this.liteCheckout = new LiteCheckout({
      apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
      returnUrl: "YOUR_RETURN_URL",
    });
  }
  
  async processPayment() {
    // Collect data from your custom form
    const customerData = {
      firstName: document.getElementById('firstName').value,
      email: document.getElementById('email').value,
    };
    
    // Set customer data using documented method
    this.liteCheckout.setPaymentData(customerData);
    
    // Set cart total using documented method
    this.liteCheckout.setCartTotal(399);
    
    // Process payment using SDK methods
    // (Specific payment method would depend on Lite SDK documentation)
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the customisation options available with the Tonder Ionic SDK, you're ready to implement payment processing in your application. Here are the recommended next steps to get you started:

- [Create a payment](/sdk-integration/mobile/ionic/make-a-payment) with the Full SDK.
- Explore the [available SDK methods](/sdk-integration/mobile/ionic/methods) for payment processing.
