Customization options for the Tonder Ionic SDK depend on whether you are using the Full or Lite version.

## Full SDK (`@tonder.io/ionic-full-sdk`)

The Full SDK provides a standardized, pre-built user interface to ensure a quick and secure integration. As such, it offers limited direct styling options. The primary method of customization is to use the **Lite SDK**.

## Lite SDK (`@tonder.io/ionic-lite-sdk`)

The Lite SDK is designed for maximum flexibility. It provides the core, secure logic for payment processing and card management but does not render a visible UI.

This approach allows you to:
-   Build your own payment form using standard Ionic components.
-   Apply your application's existing design system and styles.
-   Control the layout and user experience completely.

To implement the Lite SDK, you will create your own input fields and then pass the collected data to the SDK's `payment()` or `saveCustomerCard()` methods.
