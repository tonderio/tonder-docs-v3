This guide provides the installation and configuration steps for Tonder's Ionic SDKs.

## Prerequisites

Before installing the Tonder Ionic SDK, you need to configure your project to support secure payment processing. This involves adding the Openpay script tags for PCI DSS compliance and ensuring proper HTML structure for the SDK integration.

Add the required Openpay script tags to your main `index.html` file. These scripts are essential for PCI DSS compliance and enable the SDK to securely connect to the payment processor.

```html title="index.html"
<head>
  ...
  <script src="[https://openpay.s3.amazonaws.com/openpay.v1.min.js](https://openpay.s3.amazonaws.com/openpay.v1.min.js)"></script>
  <script src="[https://openpay.s3.amazonaws.com/openpay-data.v1.min.js](https://openpay.s3.amazonaws.com/openpay-data.v1.min.js)"></script>
  ...
</head>
```

## Installation

To install the Tonder Ionic SDK, you need to add the appropriate package to your project. Tonder provides two SDK packages depending on your needs: the Full SDK for pre-built UI or the Lite SDK for custom payment interfaces.

### Step 1: Install the SDK Package

Choose the appropriate package for your project:

- `@tonder.io/ionic-full-sdk`: use this package for a pre-built, inline checkout experience.
- `@tonder.io/ionic-lite-sdk`: use this package for building a custom payment UI.

Install the required package using your preferred package manager:

<CodeGroup>

```bash
npm i @tonder.io/ionic-full-sdk
```

```bash
yarn add @tonder.io/ionic-full-sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

### Step 2: Configure HTML Structure

Ensure your Ionic app has the proper HTML structure for the SDK to render the payment interface.

```html
<div id="tonder-checkout"></div>
<button id="pay-button">Pay Now</button>
```

## Next Steps

Now that you've successfully installed the Tonder Ionic SDK, you're ready to start integrating payments into your application. Follow these guides to complete your Ionic payment integration:

- Learn how to [make a payment](/sdk-integration/mobile/ionic/make-a-payment) using the Ionic SDK.
- Explore the [available SDK methods](/sdk-integration/mobile/ionic/methods) for payment processing.
- Customize the [SDK appearance and behavior](/sdk-integration/mobile/ionic/customization) to match your app's design.
