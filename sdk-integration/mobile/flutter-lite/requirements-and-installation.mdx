This guide provides the installation and configuration steps for Tonder's Flutter Lite SDK.

## Prerequisites

You need to add the Skyflow Maven repository to your Android project configuration to handle secure data vaulting.

1. Add the Skyflow Maven repository to your Android project configuration. This repository contains the secure data vaulting components required for PCI DSS compliance:

```gradle title="android/build.gradle"
maven {
    url '[https://maven.pkg.github.com/skyflowapi/skyflow-android-sdk](https://maven.pkg.github.com/skyflowapi/skyflow-android-sdk)'
    credentials {
        username = 'username'
        password = 'password'
    }
}
```

2. Enable AndroidX support in your project. This ensures compatibility with modern Android libraries and the Tonder SDK:

```ini title="android/gradle.properties"
android.useAndroidX=true
```

## Installation

To install the Tonder Flutter Lite SDK, you need to add the Lite SDK package to your project and configure mobile environment permissions. The Lite SDK is designed for maximum flexibility and complete UI control, allowing you to build custom payment forms.

### Step 1: Install the SDK Package

Add the Lite SDK package to your `pubspec.yaml` file or use `flutter pub add`:

```bash
flutter pub add tonder_sdk_lite
```

### Step 2: Configure Mobile Environment Permissions

You must grant internet permissions for the SDK to function correctly on native devices.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Android">
Add the INTERNET permission to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="iOS / macOS">
For iOS and macOS, add the network client entitlement to your `.entitlements` files.

```xml
<key>com.apple.security.network.client</key>
<true/>
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
