This guide walks you through processing a payment using the **Full SDK** (`InlineCheckout`) for Flutter.

---

## Prerequisites

-   You have successfully [installed and configured](/sdk-integration/mobile/flutter/installation) the Tonder Flutter SDK.
-   You have a widget in your app ready to display the checkout.

---

## Steps

### 1. Initialize the SDK

Create an instance of the `InlineCheckout` class, providing your API key and return URL.

```dart title="checkout_widget.dart"
import 'package:full_sdk/inline_checkout.dart';

// ... inside your widget's state

late InlineCheckout? _fullPlugin;

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
  const returnUrl = "YOUR_RETURN_URL";

  _fullPlugin = InlineCheckout(
    apiKeyTonder: apiKey,
    returnUrl: returnUrl,
    successUrl: returnUrl,
    renderPaymentButton: false, // Set to true if you want the SDK's button
  );
}
```

2. Configure Payment Data
Before displaying the checkout, you must provide the customer and cart details using the SDK's methods.

```dart

// Set customer and cart data
final customerData = { 'first_name': 'Juan', 'email': 'juan@example.com' };
_fullPlugin!.setPaymentData(customerData);
_fullPlugin!.setCartTotal(399);
```

3. Inject the Checkout and Process Payment
Call injectCheckout() to render the checkout form. The payment action is handled by the component injected by the SDK.

```dart

// Inject the UI into the widget tree
await _fullPlugin!.injectCheckout();
```

The SDK's component will handle the user interaction for submitting the payment.
