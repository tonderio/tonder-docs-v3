<Warning>
The Full SDK (`full_sdk`) does not support customization as it provides a standardized, pre-built user interface. For custom payment forms and styling, you must use the Lite SDK (`tonder_sdk_lite`).
</Warning>

## Lite SDK Customization

The Lite SDK is designed for maximum flexibility and complete UI control. It provides the core, secure logic for payment processing without rendering any visible UI, allowing you to build a completely custom payment experience.

This approach offers the following benefits:

- Build your own payment form using standard Flutter widgets.
- Apply your application's existing design system and styles.
- Control the layout, flow, and interactions completely.
- All payment logic remains secure and PCI-compliant.

### Implementation Approach

To implement the Lite SDK, you will create your own input fields and then pass the collected data to the SDK's payment methods.

Here's a simple example showing how to use the Lite SDK with custom UI. This code creates a custom payment widget that collects user input through Flutter's standard TextField component and then uses the SDK's documented methods to process the payment data:

```dart
import 'package:tonder_sdk_lite/lite_checkout.dart';

class CustomPaymentWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CustomPaymentWidgetState createState() => _CustomPaymentWidgetState();
}

class _CustomPaymentWidgetState extends State<CustomPaymentWidget> {
  late LiteCheckout _liteCheckout;
  final _emailController = TextEditingController();
  
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialize the Lite SDK (based on documented constructor)
    _liteCheckout = LiteCheckout(
      apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
      returnUrl: "YOUR_RETURN_URL",
    );
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        // Your custom email field
        TextField(
          controller: _emailController,
          decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Email'),
        ),
        
        // Your custom payment button
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _processPayment,
          child: Text('Process Payment'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
  
  void _processPayment() async {
    // Set customer data using documented method
    final customerData = {
      'first_name': 'Customer',
      'email': _emailController.text,
    };
    _liteCheckout.setPaymentData(customerData);
    
    // Set cart total using documented method
    _liteCheckout.setCartTotal(399);
    
    // Process payment using SDK methods
    // (Specific payment method would depend on Lite SDK documentation)
  }
}
```
