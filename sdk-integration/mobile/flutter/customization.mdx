Customization options for the Tonder Flutter SDK depend on whether you are using the Full or Lite version.

---

## Full SDK (`full_sdk`)

The Full SDK provides a standardized, pre-built user interface to ensure a quick and secure integration. As such, it offers limited direct styling options. The primary method of customization is to use the **Lite SDK**.

## Lite SDK (`tonder_sdk_lite`)

The Lite SDK is designed for maximum flexibility. It provides the core, secure logic for payment processing but does not render a visible UI.

This approach allows you to:
-   Build your own payment form using standard Flutter widgets.
-   Apply your application's existing design system and styles.
-   Control the layout and user experience completely.

To implement the Lite SDK, you will create your own input fields and then pass the collected data to the SDK's payment methods.
