This guide provides the installation and configuration steps for Tonder's Flutter SDKs.

## Prerequisites

You need to add the Skyflow Maven repository to your Android project configuration to handle secure data vaulting.

1. Add the Skyflow Maven repository to your Android project configuration. This repository contains the secure data vaulting components required for PCI DSS compliance:

```gradle title="android/build.gradle"
maven {
    url '[https://maven.pkg.github.com/skyflowapi/skyflow-android-sdk](https://maven.pkg.github.com/skyflowapi/skyflow-android-sdk)'
    credentials {
        username = 'username'
        password = 'password'
    }
}
```

2. Enable AndroidX support in your project. This ensures compatibility with modern Android libraries and the Tonder SDK:

```ini title="android/gradle.properties"
android.useAndroidX=true
```

## Installation

To install the Tonder Flutter SDK, you need to add the appropriate package to your project and configure mobile environment permissions. Tonder provides two SDK packages depending on your needs: the Full SDK for pre-built UI or the Lite SDK for custom payment interfaces.

### Step 1: Install the SDK Package

Choose the appropriate package for your project:

- `tonder_sdk_lite`: use this package for building a custom payment UI.
- `full_sdk`: use this package for a pre-built, inline checkout experience.

Add the required package to your `pubspec.yaml` file or use `flutter pub add`:

```bash
flutter pub add full_sdk
```

### Step 2: Configure Mobile Environment Permissions

You must grant internet permissions for the SDK to function correctly on native devices.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Android">
Add the INTERNET permission to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="iOS / macOS">
For iOS and macOS, add the network client entitlement to your `.entitlements` files.

```xml
<key>com.apple.security.network.client</key>
<true/>
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Next Steps

Now that you've successfully installed the Tonder Flutter SDK, you're ready to start integrating payments into your application. Follow these guides to complete your Flutter payment integration:

- Learn how to [make a payment](/sdk-integration/mobile/flutter/make-a-payment) using the Flutter SDK.
- Explore the [available SDK methods](/sdk-integration/mobile/flutter/methods) for payment processing.
- Customize the [SDK appearance and behavior](/sdk-integration/mobile/flutter/customization) to match your app's design.
