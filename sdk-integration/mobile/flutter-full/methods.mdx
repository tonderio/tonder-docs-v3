This page provides a reference for the core methods available in the `InlineCheckout` class of the Flutter Full SDK.

## Core Methods

The Tonder Flutter Full SDK provides these essential methods for initializing, configuring, and rendering the payment interface. Each method serves a specific purpose in the payment integration workflow.

| Method               | Description                                                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `new InlineCheckout(..)` | Initializes the SDK with configuration like `apiKeyTonder` and `returnUrl`.     |
| `setPaymentData(data)` | Loads the customer data (name, email, etc.) into the SDK instance.              |
| `setCartTotal(total)`| Sets the total amount for the transaction.                                      |
| `injectCheckout()`   | Renders the pre-built checkout UI.                                              |

## Method Details

Each method in the Tonder Flutter Full SDK serves a specific purpose in the payment integration workflow. Below you'll find detailed information about each method, including their parameters, usage examples, and practical implementation guidance.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="InlineCheckout Constructor">

Creates a new instance of the InlineCheckout class with the necessary configuration for secure payment processing. This constructor establishes the connection with Tonder's services and configures the payment environment.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `apiKeyTonder` | String | Your Tonder API key for authentication |
| `returnUrl` | String | URL where users are redirected after payment completion |
| `successUrl` | String | URL for successful payment redirects |
| `renderPaymentButton` | bool | Whether to show the SDK's built-in payment button |

Here's an example of how to initialize the InlineCheckout class:

```dart
InlineCheckout(
  apiKeyTonder: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  returnUrl: "https://your-app.com/return",
  successUrl: "https://your-app.com/success",
  renderPaymentButton: false,
)
```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="setPaymentData">

Configures the customer information that will be used during the payment process. This data is used to pre-fill the checkout form and associate the transaction with the customer.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `data` | Map\<String, dynamic> | Customer information including name, email, etc. |

Here's an example of how to set the customer data:

```dart
final customerData = {
  'first_name': 'Juan',
  'last_name': 'Pérez',
  'email': 'juan.perez@example.com'
};
_fullPlugin!.setPaymentData(customerData);
```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="setCartTotal">

Sets the total amount for the transaction. This value is displayed in the checkout interface and used for payment processing.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `total` | int | Total amount in cents (e.g., 399 for $3.99) |

Here's an example of how to set the cart total:

```dart
_fullPlugin!.setCartTotal(399); // $3.99
```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="injectCheckout">

Renders the pre-built payment interface within your Flutter widget. This method creates the complete checkout form with card input fields, validation, and styling.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| None | - | This method takes no parameters |

Here's an example of how to inject the checkout:

```dart
await _fullPlugin!.injectCheckout();
```

  </Accordion>
