This guide walks you through processing a payment using the Tonder React Native SDK. You'll learn how to wrap your app with the TonderProvider, create payment instances, and render the complete payment interface.

## Prerequisites

Before you can process payments with the Tonder React Native SDK, ensure you have completed the necessary setup and have the required components in place.

- You have successfully [installed and configured](/sdk-integration/mobile/react-native/installation) the Tonder SDK.
- You have a screen in your app where you can implement the checkout flow.

## Payment Integration Steps

Follow these steps to integrate payment processing into your React Native application. This process involves configuring the SDK provider, creating payment instances, and rendering the complete payment interface.

### Step 1: Wrap Your App with TonderProvider

Configure your app to use the Tonder SDK by wrapping your root component with the `TonderProvider`. This component initializes the SDK and makes its functions available to all child components via React Context.

```jsx title="App.js"
import { TonderProvider, SDKType } from '@tonder.io/rn-sdk';

function App() {
  return (
    <TonderProvider
      config={{
        type: SDKType.INLINE,
        mode: 'development',
        apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
      }}
    >
      {/* Your application's navigation and screens go here */}
      <YourCheckoutScreen />
    </TonderProvider>
  );
}
```

### Step 2: Create the Payment Instance

In your checkout screen, use the `useTonder` hook to access the SDK's create method. This method configures the payment session with a secure token from your backend and the payment data.

```js
import { useTonder } from '@tonder.io/rn-sdk';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

export default function PaymentScreen() {
  const { create } = useTonder();

  useEffect(() => {
    const initializePayment = async () => {
      // 1. Fetch a secure token from your backend
      const secureToken = await getSecureToken(); 
      
      // 2. Define your payment data
      const paymentData = {
        customer: { firstName: "Juan", email: "juan.hernandez@mail.com", /* ... */ },
        cart: { total: 399, items: [ /* ... */ ] },
        currency: "mxn"
      };

      // 3. Create the payment instance
      await create({
        secureToken: secureToken,
        paymentData: paymentData,
      });
    };
    
    initializePayment();
  }, []);

  // ... rest of your component
}
```

### Step 3: Render the Payment Component

Render the `TonderPayment` component to display the complete pre-built checkout UI. This component includes the card form, payment button, and any saved cards or alternative payment methods, with automatic payment submission and 3DS flow handling.

```js
import { TonderPayment } from '@tonder.io/rn-sdk';
import { SafeAreaView } from 'react-native';

export default function PaymentScreen() {
  // ... (previous useEffect code)

  return (
    <SafeAreaView>
      <TonderPayment />
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}
```

Here's how the payment screen will look in your React Native app:

## Next Steps

Now that you've successfully integrated payment processing into your React Native app, explore these advanced features to enhance your payment experience:

- Explore the [available SDK methods](/sdk-integration/mobile/react-native/methods) for advanced payment operations.
- Customize the [SDK appearance and behavior](/sdk-integration/mobile/react-native/customization) to match your app's design.
- Learn how to [enroll payment methods](/sdk-integration/mobile/react-native/enroll-payment-method) for returning customers.
