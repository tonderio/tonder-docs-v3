This guide walks you through the process of making a payment using the Tonder React Native SDK.

---

## Prerequisites

-   You have successfully [installed and configured](/sdk-integration/mobile/react-native/installation) the Tonder SDK.
-   You have a screen in your app where you can implement the checkout flow.

---

## Steps

### 1. Wrap Your App with `TonderProvider`

To use the SDK, you must wrap your root component or the relevant part of your application with the `TonderProvider`. This component initializes the SDK and makes its functions available to all child components via a React Context.

```jsx title="App.js"
import { TonderProvider, SDKType } from '@tonder.io/rn-sdk';

function App() {
  return (
    <TonderProvider
      config={{
        type: SDKType.INLINE,
        mode: 'development',
        apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
      }}
    >
      {/* Your application's navigation and screens go here */}
      <YourCheckoutScreen />
    </TonderProvider>
  );
}
```

2. Create the Payment Instance
In your checkout screen, use the useTonder hook to access the SDK's create method. You must call this method to configure the payment session. It requires a secure token obtained from your backend and the payment data.

```js

import { useTonder } from '@tonder.io/rn-sdk';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

export default function PaymentScreen() {
  const { create } = useTonder();

  useEffect(() => {
    const initializePayment = async () => {
      // 1. Fetch a secure token from your backend
      const secureToken = await getSecureToken(); 
      
      // 2. Define your payment data
      const paymentData = {
        customer: { firstName: "Juan", email: "juan.hernandez@mail.com", /* ... */ },
        cart: { total: 399, items: [ /* ... */ ] },
        currency: "mxn"
      };

      // 3. Create the payment instance
      await create({
        secureToken: secureToken,
        paymentData: paymentData,
      });
    };
    
    initializePayment();
  }, []);

  // ... rest of your component
}
```

3. Render the Payment Component

Finally, render the TonderPayment component. This component displays the entire pre-built checkout UI, including the card form, payment button, and any saved cards or alternative payment methods. The SDK handles the payment submission and 3DS flow automatically.

```js

import { TonderPayment } from '@tonder.io/rn-sdk';
import { SafeAreaView } from 'react-native';

export default function PaymentScreen() {
  // ... (previous useEffect code)

  return (
    <SafeAreaView>
      <TonderPayment />
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}
```
