This guide shows you how to enroll and manage payment methods using the React Native SDK. You'll learn how to configure the SDK for card enrollment, create enrollment instances, and render the secure card saving interface.

Enrolling a payment method allows you to securely save a customer's card details, making it easier for them to make repeat purchases. This process involves tokenizing the card information so that you never have to store sensitive data directly.

## Prerequisites

Before you can enroll payment methods with the Tonder React Native SDK, ensure you have completed the necessary setup and have the required components in place.

- You have successfully [installed and configured](/sdk-integration/mobile/react-native/installation) the Tonder SDK for React Native.
- Your backend is set up to provide a [Secure Token](/sdk-integration/web/js-lite/make-a-payment) for card management operations.

## Payment Method Enrollment Steps

Follow these steps to implement payment method enrollment in your React Native application. This process involves configuring the SDK for enrollment mode, creating enrollment instances, and rendering the secure card saving interface.

### Step 1: Configure the SDK in Enrollment Mode

Configure the `TonderProvider` with the `SDKType.ENROLLMENT` to prepare the SDK for the card saving workflow instead of a one-time payment. This mode enables card management functionality.

```jsx title="App.js"
import { TonderProvider, SDKType } from '@tonder.io/rn-sdk';

function App() {
  return (
    <TonderProvider
      config={{
        type: SDKType.ENROLLMENT,
        mode: 'development',
        apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
      }}
    >
      <YourEnrollmentScreen />
    </TonderProvider>
  );
}
```

### Step 2: Create the Enrollment Instance

In your enrollment screen, use the create function from the useTonder hook to initialize the enrollment session. Provide the secure token from your backend and the customer's information, along with optional callback functions.

```js
import { useTonder, SDKType, ICustomer } from '@tonder.io/rn-sdk';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

export default function EnrollmentScreen() {
  const { create } = useTonder<SDKType.ENROLLMENT>();

  const customerData: ICustomer = {
    email: 'customer@example.com',
    firstName: 'Jane',
    lastName: 'Doe'
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    const initializeEnrollment = async () => {
      const secureToken = await getSecureToken(); 

      const { error } = await create({
        secureToken: secureToken,
        customer: customerData,
        callbacks: {
          onFinishSave: (response) => {
            console.log('Card saved successfully:', response);
          }
        }
      });
      if (error) { console.error('Enrollment error:', error); }
    };

    initializeEnrollment();
  }, []);

  // ... render component
}
```

### Step 3: Render the Enrollment Form

Render the `TonderEnrollment` component to display the pre-built, secure form for users to enter their card details. This component includes all necessary input fields, validations, and a "Save Card" button.

```js
import { TonderEnrollment } from '@tonder.io/rn-sdk';
import { SafeAreaView } from 'react-native';

export default function EnrollmentScreen() {
  // ... (previous code)

  return (
    <SafeAreaView>
      <TonderEnrollment />
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}
```

### Step 4: Custom Submission (Optional)

If you need a custom submission button, you can hide the default one via customization options and call the `saveCustomerCard` method manually. This gives you complete control over the user experience.

```js
// Hide the default button via customization
const customization = {
  paymentButton: {
    show: false
  }
};

// Call saveCustomerCard manually
const { saveCustomerCard } = useTonder();

const handleCustomSave = async () => {
  try {
    await saveCustomerCard();
    console.log('Card saved successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error saving card:', error);
  }
};
```

## Next Steps

Now that you've successfully implemented payment method enrollment in your React Native app, explore these advanced features to enhance your payment experience:

- Learn how to [create a payment](/sdk-integration/mobile/react-native/create-a-payment) using the React Native SDK.
- Explore the [available SDK methods](/sdk-integration/mobile/react-native/methods) for payment processing.
- Customize the [SDK appearance and behavior](/sdk-integration/mobile/react-native/customization) to match your app's design.
