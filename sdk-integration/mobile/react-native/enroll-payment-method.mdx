Enrolling a payment method allows you to securely save a customer's card details, making it easier for them to make repeat purchases. This process involves tokenizing the card information so that you never have to store sensitive data directly.

---

## Prerequisites

-   You have successfully [installed and configured](/sdk-integration/mobile/react-native/installation) the Tonder SDK for React Native.
-   Your backend is set up to provide a [Secure Token](/sdk-integration/web/js-lite/make-a-payment) for card management operations.

---

## Steps

### 1. Configure the SDK in Enrollment Mode

First, configure the `TonderProvider` with the `SDKType.ENROLLMENT`. This prepares the SDK for the card saving workflow instead of a one-time payment.

```jsx title="App.js"
import { TonderProvider, SDKType } from '@tonder.io/rn-sdk';

function App() {
  return (
    <TonderProvider
      config={{
        type: SDKType.ENROLLMENT,
        mode: 'development',
        apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
      }}
    >
      <YourEnrollmentScreen />
    </TonderProvider>
  );
}
```

2. Create the Enrollment Instance
In your enrollment screen, use the create function from the useTonder hook. You must provide the secure token obtained from your backend and the customer's information. You can also define an onFinishSave callback to handle the successful response.

```js

import { useTonder, SDKType, ICustomer } from '@tonder.io/rn-sdk';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

export default function EnrollmentScreen() {
  const { create } = useTonder<SDKType.ENROLLMENT>();

  const customerData: ICustomer = {
    email: 'customer@example.com',
    firstName: 'Jane',
    lastName: 'Doe'
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    const initializeEnrollment = async () => {
      const secureToken = await getSecureToken(); 

      const { error } = await create({
        secureToken: secureToken,
        customer: customerData,
        callbacks: {
          onFinishSave: (response) => {
            console.log('Card saved successfully:', response);
          }
        }
      });
      if (error) { console.error('Enrollment error:', error); }
    };

    initializeEnrollment();
  }, []);

  // ... render component
}
```

3. Render the Enrollment Form
The TonderEnrollment component renders a pre-built, secure form for users to enter their card details. It includes all necessary input fields, validations, and a "Save Card" button.

```js

import { TonderEnrollment } from '@tonder.io/rn-sdk';
import { SafeAreaView } from 'react-native';

export default function EnrollmentScreen() {
  // ... (previous code)

  return (
    <SafeAreaView>
      <TonderEnrollment />
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}
```

If you need a custom submission button, you can hide the default one via customization options and call the saveCustomerCard method manually.
