This tutorial provides a high-level overview of the steps required to integrate any Tonder SDK and process your first payment. By the end of this guide, you will understand the fundamental integration workflow.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Your Tonder API Keys, which you can find in the **Developers** section of the [Tonder Dashboard](https://stage.tonder.io/dashboard/developers/).
- A development environment for your chosen platform (Web, iOS, or Android).

## Integration Steps

Follow these four essential steps to integrate Tonder into your application and process your first payment. Each step builds upon the previous one, creating a complete payment integration workflow.

### 1. Choose and install your SDK

First, you need to select the right SDK for your platform. Tonder provides dedicated SDKs for web (JavaScript) and mobile (React Native, Ionic, Flutter).

Follow the specific installation instructions for your chosen platform:

  <Card 
    title="Mobile SDK Installation" 
    icon="mobile"
    href="/sdk-integration/mobile/overview"
  >
    Install Tonder SDKs for Flutter, Ionic, or React Native applications.
  </Card>
  <Card 
    title="Web SDK Installation" 
    icon="js"
    href="/sdk-integration/web/overview"
  >
    Install Tonder JavaScript SDKs for web applications.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 2. Initialize and configure the SDK

Once installed, you need to initialize the SDK within your application and configure it for your checkout. This step involves:

- Providing your public API key and configuring the environment (e.g., `development` or `production`)
- Setting up customer and cart details, such as the total amount and currency
- Choosing between embedding individual payment fields into your custom checkout form or rendering a complete, pre-built UI

This establishes a secure connection between your application and Tonder's services and prepares the checkout interface for payment processing.

### 3. Process a payment

With the checkout displayed, the final step is to call the SDK's payment function. This function securely captures the user's payment details, sends them to Tonder for processing, and returns the transaction result.

For detailed, step-by-step instructions, refer to the guide for your specific platform:
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card 
    title="Mobile SDK" 
    icon="mobile"
    href="/sdk-integration/mobile/overview"
  >
    Make a payment with the Mobile SDK.
  </Card>
  <Card 
    title="Web SDK" 
    icon="js"
    href="/sdk-integration/web/overview"
  >
    Make a payment with the Web SDK.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
