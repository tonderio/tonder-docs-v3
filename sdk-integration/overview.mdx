Tonder's Software Development Kits (SDKs) are powerful tools designed to help you integrate our payment processing services directly into your web and mobile applications. By using our SDKs, you can create a seamless and secure checkout experience for your customers with minimal development effort.

The primary benefits of using Tonder SDKs include:

-   Simplified Integration: our SDKs provide clear, well-documented functions and components that streamline the integration process, saving you valuable development time.
-   Enhanced Security: Tonder SDKs are built with security as a priority. They handle sensitive payment data by securely collecting and tokenizing it, ensuring you meet PCI DSS requirements without the data ever touching your servers.

## SDK Integration Workflow

Integrating a Tonder SDK follows a consistent workflow. The process ensures that you can securely initialize a session, display payment options, and process transactions, including handling 3D Secure authentication when required.

The typical workflow involves:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialization">
    Your application requests a secure token from your backend to initialize the SDK.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configuration">
    You configure the SDK with customer and cart information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="UI Injection">
    The SDK renders the necessary payment fields or a full checkout UI within your application.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Payment Processing">
    The user submits their payment information, which the SDK securely sends to Tonder for processing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="3DS Handling">
    If required, the SDK automatically handles the 3D Secure challenge.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Response">
    Tonder returns the final transaction status to your application.
  </Step>
</Steps>
