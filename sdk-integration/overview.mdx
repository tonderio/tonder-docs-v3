Tonder's Software Development Kits (SDKs) are powerful tools designed to help you integrate our payment processing services directly into your web and mobile applications. By using our SDKs, you can create a seamless and secure checkout experience for your customers with minimal development effort.

The primary benefits of using Tonder SDKs include:

-   **Simplified Integration**: Our SDKs provide clear, well-documented functions and components that streamline the integration process, saving you valuable development time.
-   **Enhanced Security**: Tonder SDKs are built with security as a priority. They handle sensitive payment data by securely collecting and tokenizing it, ensuring you meet PCI DSS requirements without the data ever touching your servers.

## SDK Integration Workflow

Integrating a Tonder SDK follows a consistent workflow. The process ensures that you can securely initialize a session, display payment options, and process transactions, including handling 3D Secure authentication when required.


The typical workflow involves:
1.  **Initialization**: Your application requests a secure token from your backend to initialize the SDK.
2.  **Configuration**: You configure the SDK with customer and cart information.
3.  **UI Injection**: The SDK renders the necessary payment fields or a full checkout UI within your application.
4.  **Payment Processing**: The user submits their payment information, which the SDK securely sends to Tonder for processing.
5.  **3DS Handling**: If required, the SDK automatically handles the 3D Secure challenge.
6.  **Response**: Tonder returns the final transaction status to your application.
