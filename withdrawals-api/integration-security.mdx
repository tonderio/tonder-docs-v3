---

This section covers the essential requirements for integrating with the Tonder Withdrawals API, including authentication, security best practices, and data format specifications.

## Base URLs

The Withdrawals API is available in two environments:

| Environment | Base URL (v1) | Purpose |
|-------------|---------------|---------|
| Stage | `https://stage.tonder.io/api/v1` | Development and testing |
| Production | `https://prod.tonder.io/api/v1` | Live transactions |

<Note>
Always use the correct base URL for your environment. Using production URLs in stage or vice-versa will result in authentication errors.
</Note>

## Authentication

All requests require a token in the `Authorization` header.

### Header Format

Include your API token in the Authorization header with the following format:

```http
Authorization: Token 304fbdd...
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://stage.tonder.io/api/v1/withdrawals/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": 12345,
    "amount": 1000.00,
    "currency": "MXN",
    "transfer_method": "SPEI",
    ...
  }'
```

<Warning>
**Security Best Practices**

- Always use HTTPS for communications
- Never expose your secret API key in client-side code
- Store API keys securely on your server
- Set up alerts for unusual withdrawal patterns
</Warning>

## Data Format Requirements

### Timestamps

All timestamps must be in **ISO 8601 format**.

Examples:
- `2024-07-26T10:30:00Z`
- `2024-07-26T10:30:00+00:00`

### Currency Amounts

Currency amounts must be provided as **decimal numbers**.

Examples:
- `1000.00` (correct)
- `1000` (correct)
- `"1000.00"` (incorrect - should not be a string)

### JSON Content Type

All requests with a body must include the `Content-Type: application/json` header.

## Next Steps

- Learn about [environment configuration](/withdrawals-api/environments)
- Review the [create withdrawal guide](/withdrawals-api/guides/create-withdrawal) to see authentication in action
- Check [HTTP response codes](/withdrawals-api/reference/http-response-codes) to understand API responses
