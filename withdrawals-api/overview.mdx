This page is the consolidated Single Source of Truth for developers integrating the Tonder Withdrawals API, providing all necessary details, constraints, and process flows.

<Note>
**Authentication Required**

Every single request to the Withdrawals API requires authentication using a token in the `Authorization` header. This applies to all API requests, Postman requests, and testing scenarios.

**Include this header in every request:**
```
Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY
```
Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the token provided in the Developers section of the Tonder platform.

Requests without proper authentication will return a `401 Unauthorized` error.
