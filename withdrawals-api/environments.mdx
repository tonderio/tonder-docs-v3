---

Tonder provides two distinct environments for the Withdrawals API: Stage for development and testing, and Production for live transactions.

## Environment Overview

| Environment | Base URL | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Stage** | `https://stage.tonder.io/api/v1` | Development, testing, and integration validation |
| **Production** | `https://app.tonder.io/api/v1` | Live withdrawal processing |

## Stage Environment

The Stage environment is designed for development and testing purposes. Use this environment to:

- Test your integration before going live
- Validate withdrawal request formats
- Test webhook handling
- Verify error scenarios
- Simulate different withdrawal statuses

<Info>
**Test Institution Code**

When testing in the Stage environment, use institution code **97846** for the `beneficiary_institution` field. This is a special test code that simulates bank responses without processing actual transfers.
</Info>

## Production Environment

The Production environment processes real withdrawals and transfers funds to actual beneficiary accounts. Only use this environment when:

- Your integration is fully tested and validated
- You have completed all testing requirements
- You're ready to process live transactions
- You have proper error handling and monitoring in place

<Warning>
**Production Safety**

- Never use production API keys in client-side code
- Always test thoroughly in Stage before using Production
- Monitor your first production withdrawals closely
- Set up proper alerting for production transactions
</Warning>

## API Credentials

Each environment requires separate API credentials:

- **Stage Credentials**: Available in the **Developers section** of the Tonder Staging Dashboard
- **Production Credentials**: Available in the **Developers section** of the Tonder Production Dashboard

<Warning>
**Authentication Required for All Requests**

**Every single request** to the Withdrawals API requires authentication using the `Authorization` header:

```http
Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY
```

This applies to:
- All API requests (cURL, HTTP clients, SDKs)
- All Postman requests
- All testing requests

Get your API token from the **Developers section** in the Tonder platform. See [Authentication requirements](/withdrawals-api/integration-security) for detailed instructions.
</Warning>

<Note>
API keys are environment-specific. Using Stage keys with Production URLs (or vice-versa) will result in authentication errors.
</Note>

## Environment Switching

When switching between environments, ensure you:

1. Update the base URL in your API client
2. Use the correct API credentials for that environment
3. Update webhook endpoints if configured
4. Verify the environment matches your testing or production needs
