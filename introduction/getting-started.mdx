  {/* <Step title="Connect to providers">
    This step will walk you through the initial setup of connections.
    To integrate Tonder with payment providers, do the following:

    1. Navigate to the [Connections](../dashboard/connections) section of the dashboard.
    2. Select the payment provider you want to connect.
    3. Enter the respective payment provider Sandbox(test) API Keys.
    4. Click the **Connect** button.

    <Check>
      You can check if the connection is successful by going to the [**Your Connections**](../dashboard/connections#your-connections) section.
    </Check>
  </Step> */}

  <Step title="Create a payment link">

    To simulate a payment, you need to create a payment link inside the dashboard. To create a payment link, perform the following steps:

    1. Access the [Payment Links](../dashboard/payment-links) section of the dashboard.
    2. Click the **+Create** button on the top-right corner.
    3. Fill in the required fields. As this is a simulation, any data will be sufficient.
    4. Click the **Create new Link** button at the top of the screen.

    Below you will find a example of the payment link creation process:

  </Step>

  <Step title="Process your first payment">    
    
    With the payment link in hand you need to pay it using a test card. To execute the payment, you need to:

    1. Access the payment link.
    2. Select **Pay with Credit/debit card**.
    3. Use one of the following test cards:
