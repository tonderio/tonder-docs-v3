<Warning>
Due to PCI DSS requirements, your company must share relevant attestation documents before Tonder activates production endpoint access. Contact your Tonder representative for compliance requirements.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  The X-Skyflow-Authorization header needs to be in the following format:

  `X-Skyflow-Authorization: <ACCESS_TOKEN_FROM_TOKENIZATION_AUTH>`
</Warning>

Securely tokenize sensitive card data using Tonder's vault service. This endpoint converts each card field into individual tokens that can be safely stored and used for payment processing.

## How Tokenization Works

Tonder tokenizes **each card field individually** rather than creating a single token for the entire card. This means:

- Each sensitive field (card number, CVV, expiration month, etc.) receives its own unique token
- Tokens must be used in their corresponding fields when making payment requests
- Tokens are not interchangeable between fields

## Authentication Flow

Before using this endpoint, you must:

1. **Get an access token** using the [Get Tokenization Access Token](/reference/get-tokenization-token) endpoint
2. **Use the access token** in the `X-Skyflow-Authorization` header for this request
3. **Use the tokens** in payment requests via the [Process Transaction](/reference/process-transaction) endpoint

## Security Requirements

### PCI Compliance

Before using tokenization in production:
- Submit PCI DSS compliance documentation
- Complete security questionnaire  
- Undergo security review process
- Receive production endpoint access approval

### Best Practices

- **Use immediately**: Send card data for tokenization immediately after collection
- **Don't store raw data**: Never store unencrypted card data on your servers
- **Secure transmission**: Always use HTTPS for all tokenization requests
- **Token storage**: Safely store the returned tokens for future payment processing

## Field Requirements

All card fields are required for tokenization:

| Field | Format | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `card_number` | 13-19 digits | The complete card number without spaces or dashes |
| `cardholder_name` | String (max 255 chars) | Name as it appears on the card |
| `cvv` | 3-4 digits | Card security code |
| `expiration_month` | MM format | Two-digit month (01-12) |
| `expiration_year` | YYYY format | Four-digit year |

## Response Format

The response contains individual tokens for each field:

```json
{
  "card_number": "9230-0892-4469-1474",        // Token for card number
  "cardholder_name": "c05d89b2-299c-4f93-b49a-42be00d3b64b", // Token for cardholder name
  "cvv": "d31f0da3-0ed3-4ad8-8b68-14c2669a99a7",             // Token for CVV
  "expiration_month": "e401a32e-4174-424f-9688-727005f6a80e", // Token for expiration month
  "expiration_year": "bd9ccc23-3d00-4109-9626-fc6581389063"  // Token for expiration year
}
```

<Note>
**Important**: Each field is tokenized separately. Use each individual token in the corresponding field when making payment requests. The tokens are not interchangeable between fields.
