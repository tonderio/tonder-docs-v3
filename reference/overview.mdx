### Security

**Token Auth**

Token-based authentication is a secure method commonly used in web applications
to authenticate clients. In this approach, an API key, which serves as the token,
is generated and provided to the client. The token is a unique and confidential
string that acts as a form of credentials. To use it, send your HTTP requests with
an Authorization header that contains the word Token followed by a space and your token.

Example: `Authorization: Token ed883bd42c31f669df054b7c239a89fc3a5f6cca`
