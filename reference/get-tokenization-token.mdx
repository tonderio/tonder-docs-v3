<Warning>
Due to PCI DSS requirements, your company must share relevant attestation documents before Tonder activates production endpoint access. Contact your Tonder representative for compliance requirements.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  The Authorization needs to be in the following format:

  `Authorization: Token <YOUR_API_KEY>`
</Warning>

Obtain an access token required for card tokenization requests. This token should be used immediately for tokenizing card data through Tonder's secure tokenization service.

## Tokenization Flow

The complete tokenization process follows these steps:

1. **Get access token** using this endpoint
2. **Tokenize card data** using the access token with Tonder's vault service
3. **Use tokens** in payment requests instead of raw card data

### Token Properties

- **Format**: JWT (JSON Web Token)
- **Validity**: Short-lived (typically 15-30 minutes)
- **Usage**: Single-use recommended for security
- **Scope**: Card tokenization operations only

## Security Requirements

### PCI Compliance

Before using tokenization in production:
- Submit PCI DSS compliance documentation
- Complete security questionnaire
- Undergo security review process
- Receive production endpoint access approval

### Best Practices

- **Use immediately**: Don't store access tokens
- **Single use**: Request new tokens for each tokenization session
- **Secure transmission**: Always use HTTPS
- **Client-side**: Only use access tokens in secure, PCI-compliant environments
