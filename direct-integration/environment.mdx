Tonder provides two distinct environments for your integration: 

- **Stage** for development and testing
- **Production** for processing live transactions. 

Each environment has its own base URL and API credentials.

<Note>
It is crucial to use the correct base URL and API keys for each environment. Using production keys in the stage environment or vice-versa will result in authentication errors.
</Note>

## Base URLs

The base URL is the root for all API requests. Append the specific endpoint paths (e.g., [Process Transaction](/reference/process-transaction)) to the appropriate base URL.

| Environment    | Base URL                          | Purpose                               |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Stage | `https://stage.tonder.io/api/v1/` | For all development and testing.      |
| Production | `https://app.tonder.io/api/v1/`   | For processing live transactions.     |

For example, a request to the process endpoint in the Stage environment would use the following URL:

```POST https://stage.tonder.io/api/v1/process/```

The same request in the Production environment would use the following URL:

```POST https://app.tonder.io/api/v1/process/```

## API Credentials

Each environment uses a separate set of API credentials (API Key and Secret Key).

  * **Stage Credentials**: Use these for all your testing in the sandbox. They can be found in the developer section of the [Tonder Staging Dashboard](https://app.tonder.io).
  * **Production Credentials**: Use these only for live transactions. They are available in the developer section of the [Tonder Production Dashboard](https://app.tonder.io).

<Warning>
Never use your production API keys in your testing environment or expose them in client-side code. Store them securely on your server.
</Warning>

## Next Steps

- Check out [authentication methods](/direct-integration/authentication) to secure your API requests.
- Follow the [create a payment](/direct-integration/guides/create-payments/create-a-payment) guide to make your first transaction.
- Use [testing data](/direct-integration/testing-data) to simulate different payment scenarios.
