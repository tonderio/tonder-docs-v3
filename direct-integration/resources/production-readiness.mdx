## Overview

This checklist ensures your integration is ready for production deployment with proper security, monitoring, and operational procedures.

## Pre-Production Checklist

### API Configuration

* [ ] **Production API credentials**: Production keys configured securely
* [ ] **Environment separation**: Clear separation between staging and production
* [ ] **Base URL configuration**: Production base URL configured
* [ ] **API key rotation**: Process established for regular credential rotation

### Security Implementation

* [ ] **HTTPS enforcement**: All communications over HTTPS
* [ ] **Credential security**: API keys stored securely (environment variables, secret management)
* [ ] **Request validation**: Input validation and sanitization implemented
* [ ] **Error handling**: Secure error messages that don't expose sensitive data

### Integration Testing

* [ ] **All payment methods tested**: Cards, SPEI, OXXO, Mercado Pago, SafetyPay
* [ ] **All withdrawal methods tested**: SPEI and debit card withdrawals
* [ ] **Error scenarios tested**: Declined payments, validation errors, network failures
* [ ] **3DS flow tested**: Card payments requiring 3D Secure authentication
* [ ] **Webhook integration tested**: Real-time notifications working correctly

### Monitoring and Alerting

* [ ] **Transaction monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of payment success/failure rates
* [ ] **Error alerting**: Alerts for unusual error rates or API failures
* [ ] **Performance monitoring**: Response time and latency tracking
* [ ] **Webhook monitoring**: Webhook delivery success monitoring

### Operational Procedures

* [ ] **Support procedures**: Escalation paths for payment issues
* [ ] **Incident response**: Procedures for handling payment failures
* [ ] **Backup systems**: Fallback procedures for API outages
* [ ] **Documentation**: Complete operational documentation for team
* [ ] **Team training**: Staff trained on payment operations and troubleshooting

## Security Best Practices

### Credential Management

1. **Store credentials securely** - Use environment variables or secret management
2. **Use HTTPS** - Ensure all communications are encrypted
3. **Implement rate limiting** - Protect your webhook endpoints
4. **Log security events** - Monitor for suspicious activity
5. **Keep credentials rotated** - Regularly rotate API keys

### Performance Optimization

1. **Connection pooling** - Reuse HTTP connections
2. **Timeout configuration** - Set appropriate timeouts (30s recommended)
3. **Retry with backoff** - Implement exponential backoff for retries
4. **Asynchronous processing** - Use webhooks for status updates
5. **Cache lookups** - Cache transaction statuses when appropriate

## Final Deployment Checklist

### Go-Live Readiness

* [ ] **Security audit completed**: All security measures implemented and tested
* [ ] **Performance testing passed**: Load testing with expected traffic volumes
* [ ] **Monitoring active**: All monitoring and alerting systems operational
* [ ] **Backup procedures tested**: Disaster recovery procedures validated
* [ ] **Team training completed**: All team members trained on production procedures
* [ ] **Documentation updated**: All operational documentation current
* [ ] **Rollback plan ready**: Clear rollback procedures in case of issues
* [ ] **Support contacts established**: Emergency contact procedures defined
* [ ] **Compliance verified**: All regulatory requirements met
* [ ] **Final testing completed**: End-to-end testing in production environment

### Post-Deployment Monitoring

#### First 24 Hours

* Monitor all payment flows continuously
* Check error rates every 15 minutes
* Verify webhook delivery success
* Monitor system performance metrics
* Have team member on standby for issues

#### First Week

* Daily metrics review
* Weekly performance reports
* Customer feedback monitoring
* Error pattern analysis
* System optimization based on real traffic

#### Ongoing Operations

* Monthly security reviews
* Quarterly performance assessments
* Regular disaster recovery testing
* Continuous monitoring optimization
* Regular team training updates

## Next Steps

* Review Support & Resources for ongoing operational support
* Check Rate Limits for production traffic planning
* Monitor Error Handling patterns in production
* Set up Webhooks monitoring and alerting
