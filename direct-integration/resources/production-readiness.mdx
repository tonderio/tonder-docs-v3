In this page you will find checklists and important information to ensure your integration is ready for production deployment.

## Pre-Production Checklist

This checklist ensures your integration is ready for production deployment with proper security, monitoring, and operational procedures.

### API Configuration

- [ ] Configure production API credentials securely
- [ ] Establish clear separation between staging and production environments
- [ ] Set up production base URL configuration
- [ ] Implement process for regular API key rotation

### Security Implementation

- [ ] Enforce HTTPS for all communications
- [ ] Store API keys securely using environment variables or secret management
- [ ] Implement input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Ensure error messages don't expose sensitive data

### Integration Testing

- [ ] Test all payment methods (Cards, SPEI, OXXO, Mercado Pago, SafetyPay)
- [ ] Test all withdrawal methods (SPEI and debit card withdrawals)
- [ ] Test error scenarios (declined payments, validation errors, network failures)
- [ ] Test 3DS flow for card payments requiring 3D Secure authentication
- [ ] Test webhook integration for real-time notifications

### Monitoring and Alerting

- [ ] Monitor payment success/failure rates in real-time
- [ ] Set up alerts for unusual error rates or API failures
- [ ] Track response time and latency performance
- [ ] Monitor webhook delivery success rates

### Operational Procedures

- [ ] Establish escalation paths for payment issues
- [ ] Create procedures for handling payment failures
- [ ] Implement fallback procedures for API outages
- [ ] Complete operational documentation for team
- [ ] Train staff on payment operations and troubleshooting

## Security Best Practices

Here are some security best practices to follow.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Credential Management">

- **Store credentials securely** – Use environment variables or a secrets manager
- **Use HTTPS** – Make sure all communications are encrypted
- **Implement rate limiting** – Protect your webhook endpoints from abuse
- **Log security events** – Keep an eye out for anything suspicious
- **Keep credentials rotated** – Regularly rotate your API keys

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Performance Optimisation">

- **Connection pooling** – Reuse HTTP connections where possible
- **Timeout configuration** – Set sensible timeouts (30s is a good starting point)
- **Retry with backoff** – Use exponential backoff for retries
- **Asynchronous processing** – Use webhooks for status updates instead of polling
- **Cache lookups** – Cache transaction statuses when it makes sense

## Final Deployment Checklist

For the final deployment, ensure you have completed the following checklist.

- [ ] Complete security audit with all measures implemented and tested
- [ ] Pass performance testing with load testing at expected traffic volumes
- [ ] Activate all monitoring and alerting systems
- [ ] Test backup procedures and validate disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Complete team training on production procedures
- [ ] Update all operational documentation to current state
- [ ] Prepare clear rollback procedures in case of issues
- [ ] Establish emergency contact procedures and support contacts
- [ ] Verify compliance with all regulatory requirements
- [ ] Complete end-to-end testing in production environment

### Post-Deployment Monitoring

We recommend monitoring the following metrics for the first 24 hours and first week. Follow the procedures below to ensure everything is running smoothly.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="First 24 Hours">

- Keep a close eye on all payment flows, monitoring them continuously
- Check error rates every 15 minutes and investigate any spikes
- Make sure webhook deliveries are successful and retry any failures
- Track key system performance metrics (CPU, memory, latency, etc.)
- Have a team member on standby to respond quickly to any issues

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="First Week">

- Review daily metrics and logs for any anomalies
- Generate and review weekly performance reports
- Collect and monitor customer feedback for any pain points
- Analyse error patterns to spot recurring issues
- Optimise the system based on real traffic and usage data

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Ongoing Operations">

- Carry out monthly security reviews and address any findings
- Run quarterly performance assessments to ensure everything’s running smoothly
- Regularly test disaster recovery procedures
- Continuously improve monitoring and alerting setups
- Keep team training up to date with regular refreshers

</Accordion>

## Next Steps

- Review [Support & Resources](./support-and-resources) for ongoing operational support
- Check [Rate Limits](../api-reference/rate-limits) for production traffic planning
- Monitor [Error Handling](../api-reference/error-handling) patterns in production
- Set up [Webhooks](../api-reference/webhooks) monitoring and alerting
