**Tonder** provides a unified payment processing API that enables businesses to accept payments and send withdrawals across Latin America through a single, streamlined interface. Our **Direct Connect** approach eliminates complex integrations, allowing you to process transactions with a single API call.

### Key Features

* **Single Endpoint Processing**: Handle payments and withdrawals through one API
* **Regional Payment Methods**: Native support for SPEI, OXXO, Mercado Pago, and more
* **Instant Response**: Real-time processing with immediate status updates
* **Simplified Integration**: Reduce development time from weeks to days
* **Comprehensive Coverage**: Cards, bank transfers, cash, and digital wallets

### Getting Started Process

1. Sign-in to your Tonder account at [app.tonder.io](https://app.tonder.io) or request one through your Tonder Customer Success Manager
2. Get your API credentials from the developer section
3. Test your integration in the sandbox environment
4. Complete production setup and go-live process

***

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using API keys, and with HMAC SHA256 signatures when specified.

### Required Headers

```http
Authorization: Token api_key
X-Signature-Transaction: calculated_hmac_signature
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Authentication Requirements

1. **API Credentials**: Each business receives unique API key and secret key
2. **HMAC Configuration**: HMAC validation is configurable per business (active/inactive)
3. **Field Mappings**: Different endpoints may have different field mapping requirements
4. **Signature Calculation**: HMAC-SHA256 signatures ensure request integrity
5. **Base64 Encoding**: Signatures must be encoded as Base64 strings

**Important Notes:**

* HMAC validation can be configured as active/inactive per business
* Each business can configure which fields are included in signature calculation
* The system supports different field mappings for different sources (web, mobile, etc.)
* For the Direct API `/process/` endpoint, HMAC authentication will be implemented
