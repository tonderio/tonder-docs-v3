## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using API keys, and with HMAC SHA256 signatures when specified.

<Accordion.Group>

<Accordion title="Required Headers">

```http title="HTTP Headers"
Authorization: Token api_key
X-Signature-Transaction: calculated_hmac_signature
Content-Type: application/json
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Authentication Requirements">

1. **API Credentials**: Each business receives unique API key and secret key
2. **HMAC Configuration**: HMAC validation is configurable per business (active/inactive)
3. **Field Mappings**: Different endpoints may have different field mapping requirements
4. **Signature Calculation**: HMAC-SHA256 signatures ensure request integrity
5. **Base64 Encoding**: Signatures must be encoded as Base64 strings

<Callout type="info" title="Important Notes">
HMAC validation can be enabled per business; fields used in the signature are configurable; the platform supports different field mappings by source (web, mobile, etc.); the Direct API `/process/` endpoint uses HMAC authentication.
</Callout>
