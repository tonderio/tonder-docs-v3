---

Tonder Direct provides a unified payment processing API that enables your business to accept payments and send withdrawals across Latin America. Our **Direct Connect** approach simplifies integration, allowing you to process a wide range of transactions through a single, streamlined endpoint.

Instead of managing complex integrations for each payment method or country, you can handle everything with a single API call to our `/process/` endpoint.

## How It Works

The API is built around a single `/process/` endpoint that intelligently routes transactions based on the `operation_type` field in your request.

  * `operation_type: "payment"`: Initiates a [payment from a customer](/direct-integration/guides/create-payments/create-a-payment) to your business. You can specify the `payment_method`, such as [`CARD`](/direct-integration/payment-methods/card-payments), [`SPEI`](/direct-integration/payment-methods/spei-bank-transfers), or [`OXXO`](/direct-integration/payment-methods/oxxo-cash-payments).
  * `operation_type: "withdrawal"`: Initiates a [payout from your business](/direct-integration/guides/create-a-withdrawal) to a beneficiary. You can specify the `transfer_method`, such as `SPEI` or `DEBIT_CARD`.

This unified architecture means you only need to build one core integration to unlock a [full suite of payment and withdrawal capabilities](/direct-integration/payment-methods/payment-methods-overview).
