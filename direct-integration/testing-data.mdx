Use these test cards to simulate payment scenarios in the Stage environment before going live. All cards work exclusively in `https://stage.tonder.io` — they will not work in production.

<Note>
  CVV should be **3 digits** and expiration date can be **any future date** from the date of your test.
</Note>

<Tip>
  For a better experience, we recommend getting in touch with your Tonder representative to obtain test cards specific to your integration and region.
