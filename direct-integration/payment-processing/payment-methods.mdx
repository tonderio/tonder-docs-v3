## Process Card Payments

Card payments support major credit and debit cards including Visa, Mastercard, and American Express. Cards can be processed using either raw card data or tokenized card information.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Send Card Payment Request">

Here's an example of a card payment request using a tokenized card (recommended):

```json
{
  "operation_type": "payment",
  "amount": 150.00,
  "currency": "MXN",
  "customer": {
    "name": "Ana María Rodríguez",
    "email": "ana.rodriguez@email.com"
  },
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "CARD",
    "card_number": "9230-0892-4469-1474",
    "cardholder_name": "c05d89b2-299c-4f93-b49a-42be00d3b64b",

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="3D Secure Handling">

Some card transactions may require 3D Secure authentication. When this occurs, the response will include a `next_action` object:

```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "status": "pending",
  "next_action": {

      "url": "https://secure.payment-provider.com/3ds/abc123",
      "return_url": "https://yoursite.com/payment/return",
      "verify_transaction_status_url": "/api/v1/stripe/business/123/payments/456/transactions/789"
    }
  }
}
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="3D Secure Flow">

This is the usual flow of 3D Secure payments:

1. Redirect customer to the provided URL
2. Complete 3DS authentication
3. Redirect customer back to your `return_url`
4. Check transaction status using the `verify_transaction_status_url` or the main status endpoint

</Accordion>

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Implementation Examples

Here are some examples of how to implement payment methods in your application:

<CodeGroup>

```python Multi-Method Payment Flow
def process_payment_with_fallback(customer_data, amount, preferred_method):
    """Process payment with fallback methods"""
    
    payment_methods = [
        preferred_method,
        "CARD",  # Fallback to card
        "SPEI",  # Fallback to bank transfer
        "OXXO"   # Final fallback to cash
    ]
    
    for method in payment_methods:
        try:
            payment_data = {
                "operation_type": "payment",
                "amount": amount,
                "currency": "MXN",
                "customer": customer_data,
                "payment_method": {"type": method},
                "client_reference": f"order-{uuid.uuid4()}"
            }
            
            result = tonder_api.process_payment(payment_data)
            
            if result["status"] in ["authorized", "pending"]:
                return result
                
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Payment method {method} failed: {e}")
            continue
    
    raise Exception("All payment methods failed")
```

```python Payment Method Availability Check
def get_available_payment_methods(country="MX", currency="MXN"):
    """Get available payment methods for a region"""
    
    methods = {
        "MX": {
            "MXN": ["CARD", "SPEI", "OXXO", "MERCADOPAGO", "SAFETYPAY"],
            "USD": ["CARD"]
        }
    }
    
    return methods.get(country, {}).get(currency, ["CARD"])
```

</CodeGroup>
