This guide explains how to manage your webhook endpoints through the Tonder API. You'll learn to create, update, and manage webhook endpoints to receive real-time notifications.

## Prerequisites

- Tonder API credentials from your [Dashboard → Developers → API Keys](https://app.tonder.io/accounts/login/)
- A publicly accessible HTTPS endpoint to receive webhook notifications

<Note>
**Security Requirements**

Follow these essential security practices when setting up webhook endpoints:

- Always use a secure (HTTPS) URL for your webhook endpoint
- Use an authentication method (BEARER, API_TOKEN, or BASIC_AUTH) to verify requests come from Tonder
- Validate the event structure and content before processing
</Note>

## Steps

The webhook management process involves creating and configuring your endpoints through the API.

### 1. Create a webhook endpoint

Register a new URL to receive webhook notifications using the [`/webhooks/`](/reference/webhooks) endpoint. You can configure authentication to secure your endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://stage.tonder.io/api/v1/webhooks/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://your-site.com/webhook-handler",
    "auth_method": "BEARER",
    "credentials": {
      "token": "a-secure-bearer-token-you-generate"
    }
  }'
```

You should receive a response confirming the webhook endpoint was created:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | integer | Unique identifier for this webhook endpoint |
| `url` | string | The webhook URL you registered |
| `status` | string | Current status of the webhook (`active`, `inactive`) |
| `auth_method` | string | Authentication method configured (`BEARER`, `API_TOKEN`, `BASIC_AUTH`) |
| `credentials` | object | Authentication credentials associated with this webhook |

Example response:

```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "url": "https://your-site.com/webhook-handler",
  "status": "active",
  "auth_method": "BEARER",
  "credentials": {
    "token": "a-secure-bearer-token-you-generate"
  }
}
```

<Note>
Make sure to save the webhook `id` for future management operations.
</Note>

### 2. Manage existing webhooks

Once you have created webhooks, you can manage them using these [`/webhooks/`](/reference/webhooks) API endpoints:

| Operation | Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|----------|---------|
| **List Webhooks** | `GET` | `/webhooks/` | Retrieves all webhook endpoints configured for your business |
| **Update Webhook** | `PUT` | `/webhooks/{webhook_id}/` | Updates the configuration of an existing webhook endpoint |
| **Delete Webhook** | `DELETE` | `/webhooks/{webhook_id}/` | Removes a webhook endpoint (it will no longer receive notifications) |

Here are examples of each management operation:

<CodeGroup>

```bash List Webhooks
curl -X GET https://stage.tonder.io/api/v1/webhooks/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```bash Update Webhook
curl -X PUT https://stage.tonder.io/api/v1/webhooks/123/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://your-updated-site.com/webhook-handler"
  }'
```

```bash Delete Webhook
curl -X DELETE https://stage.tonder.io/api/v1/webhooks/123/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY"
```

</CodeGroup>

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common setup issues and how to resolve them:

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Authentication errors when creating webhooks">

When webhook creation fails due to authentication problems:

- Check: Verify your API credentials are correct and have proper permissions
- Solution: Ensure your endpoint validates the configured authentication method properly
- Prevention: Test authentication locally before setting up the webhook

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Webhook endpoint not receiving events after setup">

When your webhook endpoint is created successfully but doesn't receive events:

- Check: Verify your endpoint is publicly accessible via HTTPS and responds quickly
- Solution: Ensure your endpoint returns a 2xx status code within 30 seconds
- Prevention: Test your endpoint URL with tools like curl before registering it

</Accordion>
