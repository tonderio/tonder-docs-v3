Tonder's webhook system is designed for reliability. If your endpoint is temporarily unavailable, we will automatically retry the delivery.

## How Webhook Delivery Works

The webhook delivery follows these sequential steps from event creation to final resolution:

<Steps>
<Step title="Event Triggered">
A transaction status change or event occurs
</Step>
<Step title="Immediate Delivery">
Tonder sends a POST request to your webhook endpoint
</Step>
<Step title="Response Evaluation">
Your endpoint's response determines next steps
</Step>
<Step title="Success or Retry">
Based on the response, the event is marked complete or scheduled for retry
</Step>
</Steps>

## Retry Policy and Configuration

When a webhook delivery fails, Tonder automatically retries according to a predefined policy:

| Setting | Value | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Max Retry Attempts** | 3 | We will try to deliver a webhook up to 3 times |
| **Processing Timeout** | 30 seconds per attempt | Your endpoint must respond within 30 seconds |
| **Retry Interval** | 60 seconds | We wait 60 seconds before retrying a failed attempt |
| **Total Retry Window** | ~3 minutes | The maximum time spent retrying a single event |

## Success and Failure Criteria

A delivery is considered **successful** if your endpoint responds with a `2xx` HTTP status code within 30 seconds. Any other response is considered a **failure**, and a retry will be scheduled.

## Common Failure Scenarios

Based on the original webhook system, these are the failure scenarios that trigger retries:

- `4xx` errors (400, 401, 404, etc.) - Client errors indicating request problems.
- `5xx` errors (500, 502, 503, etc.) - Server errors indicating endpoint issues.
- Timeouts when no response is received after 30 seconds.

After 3 failed attempts, the message is moved to a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for manual inspection.

## Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)

The Dead Letter Queue stores failed webhook events that couldn't be delivered after all retry attempts:

- Failed events are stored for manual inspection and potential reprocessing.
- Access is available through the Tonder dashboard or support team.
- Events can be manually retried after fixing endpoint issues.

## Implementation Considerations

Key practices mentioned in the original webhook documentation:

- Acknowledge receipt immediately with a `200 OK` status to prevent timeouts.
- Use the `event_id` to deduplicate events and prevent processing the same event twice.
- Keep detailed logs of all incoming webhook events for debugging purposes.
- Ensure that malformed payloads or processing errors don't crash your system.

## Next Steps

After understanding delivery and retry logic:

- Review [webhook best practices](/direct-integration/webhooks/best-practices) for optimal implementation patterns.
- Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting for your webhook endpoints.
- Consider implementing multiple webhook endpoints for redundancy.
