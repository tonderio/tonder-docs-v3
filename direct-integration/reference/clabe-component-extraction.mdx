This reference provides functions and utilities for parsing CLABE numbers into their individual components, along with SPEI operational timing constraints and validation patterns.

<Info>
For detailed operational information about SPEI including operating hours, processing times, and holiday calendar, see the [Payment Methods Reference](/direct-integration/payment-methods/payment-methods-reference#spei-operational-information) page.

## CLABE Component Structure

CLABE numbers contain four distinct components that can be extracted for processing. For detailed information about CLABE structure and validation algorithms, see [CLABE Validation](/direct-integration/reference/clabe-validation).

A quick overview of the CLABE components:

- Bank Code (positions 1-3): Identifies the financial institution.
- Branch Code (positions 4-6): Identifies the specific branch.
- Account Number (positions 7-17): The actual account identifier.
- Check Digit (position 18): Validation digit calculated using algorithm.

## Implementation Examples

Here you can find ready-to-use code examples for common CLABE processing and SPEI validation tasks:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="CLABE Component Extraction">
    This function parses a CLABE number into its individual components for further processing:
    
    ```python
    def parse_clabe(clabe):
        """Parse CLABE into its components"""
        
        if not validate_clabe(clabe):
            raise ValueError("Invalid CLABE format")
        
        return {
            'bank_code': clabe[:3],
            'branch_code': clabe[3:6],
            'account_number': clabe[6:17],
            'check_digit': clabe[17],
            'full_clabe': clabe
        }

    # Example usage
    clabe_parts = parse_clabe("012345678901234567")
    print(f"Bank: {clabe_parts['bank_code']}")
    print(f"Branch: {clabe_parts['branch_code']}")
    print(f"Account: {clabe_parts['account_number']}")
    print(f"Check Digit: {clabe_parts['check_digit']}")
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SPEI Operating Time Validation">
    This function checks if SPEI transfers are currently being processed based on Mexico City time and operating schedules:
    
    ```python
    from datetime import datetime
    import pytz

    def is_spei_operating_time(timestamp=None):
        """Check if SPEI is currently operating"""
        
        if timestamp is None:
            timestamp = datetime.now()
        
        # Convert to Mexico City timezone
        mexico_tz = pytz.timezone('America/Mexico_City')
        if timestamp.tzinfo is None:
            timestamp = pytz.utc.localize(timestamp)
        
        mexico_time = timestamp.astimezone(mexico_tz)
        
        # Check day of week (0 = Monday, 6 = Sunday)
        weekday = mexico_time.weekday()
        hour = mexico_time.hour
        
        if weekday < 5:  # Monday to Friday
            return 6 <= hour < 18
        elif weekday == 5:  # Saturday
            return 9 <= hour < 14
        else:  # Sunday
            return False

    # Example usage
    now = datetime.now(pytz.UTC)
    is_operating = is_spei_operating_time(now)
    print(f"SPEI is {'operating' if is_operating else 'not operating'} right now")
    ```
