---

This reference provides functions and utilities for parsing CLABE numbers into their individual components, along with SPEI operational timing constraints and validation patterns.

## CLABE Component Structure

CLABE numbers contain four distinct components that can be extracted for processing. For detailed information about CLABE structure and validation algorithms, see [CLABE Validation](/direct-integration/reference/clabe-validation).

A quick overview of the CLABE components:

- Bank Code (positions 1-3): Identifies the financial institution.
- Branch Code (positions 4-6): Identifies the specific branch.
- Account Number (positions 7-17): The actual account identifier.
- Check Digit (position 18): Validation digit calculated using algorithm.

## SPEI Timing and Operational Constraints

SPEI operates with specific timing considerations that affect when transfers can be processed and completed.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Operating Hours">
    SPEI transfer processing varies by day and time, with different schedules for weekdays, weekends, and holidays:
   
    | Day/Period                | Processing Hours                | Notes                        |
    |---------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|
    | Monday to Friday          | 6:00 AM – 6:00 PM (CDMX time)   | Same-day processing if before 5:00 PM |
    | Saturday                  | 9:00 AM – 2:00 PM               | Limited processing           |
    | Sunday                    | No processing                   |                              |
    | Bank holidays             | No processing                   |                              |

    <Note>
    **Processing Times for SPEI**

    SPEI generally operates 24/7, but individual institutions may apply maintenance windows or additional validations that can introduce delays. Some banks or payment providers may apply their own internal processing schedules or restrictions.

    Possible delays may occur due to:
    - Scheduled maintenance windows
    - Anti-fraud validations
    - Institutional batch processing policies

    Please verify specific hours or limitations with your financial institution or provider.
    </Note>

  <Accordion title="Processing Time Examples">
  
    These examples show typical processing times for SPEI transfers submitted at different times and days:

    | Submission Time | Day       | Expected Processing Time  |
    | --------------- | --------- | ------------------------- |
    | 10:00 AM        | Monday    | Same day (within minutes) |
    | 4:30 PM         | Tuesday   | Same day (within minutes) |
    | 5:30 PM         | Wednesday | Same day (within minutes) |
    | 11:00 AM        | Saturday  | Same day (within minutes) |
    | 2:30 PM         | Saturday  | Same day (within minutes) |
    | 10:00 AM        | Sunday    | Same day (within minutes) |

    <Note>
    - All times are shown in local Mexico City time.
    - Actual processing times can vary depending on:
      - Your bank or fintech provider's policies
      - Internal fraud or compliance checks
      - Scheduled maintenance windows

    SPEI itself doesn't enforce business day cut-off times anymore, so in theory, transfers can go through at any hour. However, your provider or bank might still have their own restrictions or delays—so it's always worth double-checking if you need funds to arrive urgently.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Holiday Calendar">
    The following Mexican holidays may affect SPEI processing times and availability:

    - New Year's Day (January 1)
    - Constitution Day (February 5)
    - Benito Juárez's Birthday (March 21)
    - Easter (varies)
    - Labor Day (May 1)
    - Independence Day (September 16)
    - Revolution Day (November 20)
    - Christmas Day (December 25)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Time Zone Considerations">
    SPEI operates on Mexico City Time (Central Time) with the following characteristics:

    - UTC Offset: UTC-6 (Standard Time)
    - UTC Offset: UTC-5 (Daylight Time)
    - Daylight Saving: First Sunday in April to last Sunday in October

## Implementation Examples

Here you can find ready-to-use code examples for common CLABE processing and SPEI validation tasks:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="CLABE Component Extraction">
    This function parses a CLABE number into its individual components for further processing:
    
    ```python
    def parse_clabe(clabe):
        """Parse CLABE into its components"""
        
        if not validate_clabe(clabe):
            raise ValueError("Invalid CLABE format")
        
        return {
            'bank_code': clabe[:3],
            'branch_code': clabe[3:6],
            'account_number': clabe[6:17],
            'check_digit': clabe[17],
            'full_clabe': clabe
        }

    # Example usage
    clabe_parts = parse_clabe("012345678901234567")
    print(f"Bank: {clabe_parts['bank_code']}")
    print(f"Branch: {clabe_parts['branch_code']}")
    print(f"Account: {clabe_parts['account_number']}")
    print(f"Check Digit: {clabe_parts['check_digit']}")
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SPEI Operating Time Validation">
    This function checks if SPEI transfers are currently being processed based on Mexico City time and operating schedules:
    
    ```python
    from datetime import datetime
    import pytz

    def is_spei_operating_time(timestamp=None):
        """Check if SPEI is currently operating"""
        
        if timestamp is None:
            timestamp = datetime.now()
        
        # Convert to Mexico City timezone
        mexico_tz = pytz.timezone('America/Mexico_City')
        if timestamp.tzinfo is None:
            timestamp = pytz.utc.localize(timestamp)
        
        mexico_time = timestamp.astimezone(mexico_tz)
        
        # Check day of week (0 = Monday, 6 = Sunday)
        weekday = mexico_time.weekday()
        hour = mexico_time.hour
        
        if weekday < 5:  # Monday to Friday
            return 6 <= hour < 18
        elif weekday == 5:  # Saturday
            return 9 <= hour < 14
        else:  # Sunday
            return False

    # Example usage
    now = datetime.now(pytz.UTC)
    is_operating = is_spei_operating_time(now)
    print(f"SPEI is {'operating' if is_operating else 'not operating'} right now")
    ```
