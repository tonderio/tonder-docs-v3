## Bank Account Types

Different account types used in Mexican banking:

| Code | Type               | Description             |
| ---- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| 1    | Checking Account   | Cuenta de cheques       |
| 2    | Savings Account    | Cuenta de ahorros       |
| 3    | Credit Account     | Cuenta de crédito       |
| 40   | CLABE Account      | Cuenta CLABE (for SPEI) |
| 10   | Investment Account | Cuenta de inversión     |

For SPEI withdrawals, the account type is usually picked up automatically from the CLABE format. However, for some operations, you might need to specify it yourself.

This example shows a complete beneficiary object for a SPEI withdrawal request:

```json
{
  "beneficiary": {
    "account": "012345678901234567",    // 18-digit CLABE number
    "account_type": "40",               // CLABE account type for SPEI
    "name": "Roberto Martínez García",  // Account holder's full name
    "rfc": "MAGR850920XY1",            // Individual RFC (13 characters)
    "institution": "40012"             // BBVA México institution code
  }
}
```

Each field serves a specific purpose:
- `account`: The CLABE number identifying the recipient's bank account
- `account_type`: Code "40" indicates this is a CLABE account suitable for SPEI transfers
- `name`: Legal name of the account holder, must match bank records
- `rfc`: Mexican tax ID for the account holder (individual or business)
- `institution`: Bank code corresponding to the first 3 digits of the CLABE (with "40" prefix)
