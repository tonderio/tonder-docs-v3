### Operating Hours

SPEI transfer processing varies by day and time, with different schedules for weekdays, weekends, and holidays:

| Day/Period                | Processing Hours                | Notes                        |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|

<Note>
**Processing Times for SPEI**

SPEI generally operates 24/7, but individual institutions may apply maintenance windows or additional validations that can introduce delays. Some banks or payment providers may apply their own internal processing schedules or restrictions.

Possible delays may occur due to scheduled maintenance windows, anti-fraud validations, and institutional batch processing policies. Please verify specific hours or limitations with your financial institution or provider.
</Note>

### Processing Time Examples

These examples show typical processing times for SPEI transfers submitted at different times and days:

| Submission Time | Day       | Expected Processing Time  |
| --------------- | --------- | ------------------------- |
| 10:00 AM        | Monday    | Same day (within minutes) |
| 4:30 PM         | Tuesday   | Same day (within minutes) |
| 5:30 PM         | Wednesday | Same day (within minutes) |
| 11:00 AM        | Saturday  | Same day (within minutes) |
| 2:30 PM         | Saturday  | Same day (within minutes) |
| 10:00 AM        | Sunday    | Same day (within minutes) |

<Note>
All times are shown in local Mexico City time. Actual processing times can vary depending on your bank or fintech provider's policies, internal fraud or compliance checks, and scheduled maintenance windows.

SPEI itself doesn't enforce business day cut-off times anymore, so in theory, transfers can go through at any hour. However, your provider or bank might still have their own restrictions or delays—so it's always worth double-checking if you need funds to arrive urgently.
</Note>

### Holiday Calendar

The following Mexican holidays may affect SPEI processing times and availability:

- New Year's Day (January 1)
- Constitution Day (February 5)
- Benito Juárez's Birthday (March 21)
- Easter (varies)
- Labor Day (May 1)
- Independence Day (September 16)
- Revolution Day (November 20)
- Christmas Day (December 25)
