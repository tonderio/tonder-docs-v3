</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Status Flow Reference

Understanding payment status flows is crucial for proper integration. Each payment method follows a specific status progression:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Synchronous Payment Methods">
Synchronous payment methods provide immediate results, allowing you to know the payment outcome instantly. These methods process transactions in real-time and return final status immediately:

- Card Payments: `pending` → `authorized`/`declined`.
- Mercado Pago: `pending` → `success`/`failed`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Asynchronous Payment Methods">
Asynchronous payment methods require additional processing time and may involve external verification steps. These methods return an initial status and update to final status once processing is complete:

- SPEI: `pending` → `processing` → `success`.
- OXXO pay: `pending` → `success`.
- SafetyPay: `pending` → `success`.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Error Codes by Payment Method

Proper error handling is essential for a robust integration. Each payment method can return specific error codes that you should handle appropriately:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Card Payment Errors">
Card payments can fail for various reasons related to the card itself or the issuing bank. These are the most common error codes you'll encounter when processing card transactions:

- `card_declined` - Card declined by issuer.
- `insufficient_funds` - Not enough funds.
- `expired_card` - Card has expired.
- `invalid_card` - Card number invalid.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="SPEI Errors">
SPEI bank transfers have specific operational constraints and amount limitations that can cause transaction failures. These errors typically occur due to timing or amount restrictions:

- `spei_unavailable` - Outside operating hours.
- `invalid_amount` - Amount exceeds SPEI limits.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="OXXO pay/SafetyPay Errors">
Cash payment methods like OXXO pay and SafetyPay have specific amount limits to ensure transaction security and compliance. These errors occur when the transaction amount falls outside the allowed range:

- `amount_too_high` - Exceeds payment limits.
- `amount_too_low` - Below minimum payment amount.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## SPEI Operational Information

SPEI operates with specific timing considerations that affect when transfers can be processed and completed.

### Operating Hours

SPEI transfer processing varies by day and time, with different schedules for weekdays, weekends, and holidays:

| Day/Period                | Processing Hours                | Notes                        |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Monday to Friday          | 6:00 AM – 6:00 PM (CDMX time)   | Same-day processing if before 5:00 PM |
| Saturday                  | 9:00 AM – 2:00 PM               | Limited processing           |
| Sunday                    | No processing                   |                              |
| Bank holidays             | No processing                   |                              |

<Note>
**Processing Times for SPEI**

SPEI generally operates 24/7, but individual institutions may apply maintenance windows or additional validations that can introduce delays. Some banks or payment providers may apply their own internal processing schedules or restrictions.

Possible delays may occur due to scheduled maintenance windows, anti-fraud validations, and institutional batch processing policies. Please verify specific hours or limitations with your financial institution or provider.
</Note>

### Processing Time Examples

These examples show typical processing times for SPEI transfers submitted at different times and days:

| Submission Time | Day       | Expected Processing Time  |
| --------------- | --------- | ------------------------- |
| 10:00 AM        | Monday    | Same day (within minutes) |
| 4:30 PM         | Tuesday   | Same day (within minutes) |
| 5:30 PM         | Wednesday | Same day (within minutes) |
| 11:00 AM        | Saturday  | Same day (within minutes) |
| 2:30 PM         | Saturday  | Same day (within minutes) |
| 10:00 AM        | Sunday    | Same day (within minutes) |

<Note>
All times are shown in local Mexico City time. Actual processing times can vary depending on your bank or fintech provider's policies, internal fraud or compliance checks, and scheduled maintenance windows.

SPEI itself doesn't enforce business day cut-off times anymore, so in theory, transfers can go through at any hour. However, your provider or bank might still have their own restrictions or delays—so it's always worth double-checking if you need funds to arrive urgently.
</Note>

### Holiday Calendar

The following Mexican holidays may affect SPEI processing times and availability:

- New Year's Day (January 1)
- Constitution Day (February 5)
- Benito Juárez's Birthday (March 21)
- Easter (varies)
- Labor Day (May 1)
- Independence Day (September 16)
- Revolution Day (November 20)
- Christmas Day (December 25)
