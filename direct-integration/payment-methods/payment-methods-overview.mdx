This guide helps you choose and implement the best payment methods for your business using Tonder's unified API. Learn when to use each payment method and how to create a comprehensive payment strategy for your customers.

## How Payment Methods Work

All payment methods in Tonder work through the same unified `/process/` endpoint. You simply change the `payment_method.type` and provide any method-specific parameters. This makes it easy to offer multiple payment options without managing different integrations.

```json
{
  "operation_type": "payment",
  "amount": 100.00,
  "currency": "MXN",
  "customer": { /* customer data */ },
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "CARD" // or "SPEI", "OXXO", "MERCADOPAGO", "SAFETYPAY"
  },
  "client_reference": "order-123"
}
```

## Choosing the Right Payment Methods

### For E-commerce Stores

**Primary recommendation:**
1. **Card Payments** - For immediate payment confirmation
2. **OXXO** - For cash-preferred customers
3. **SPEI** - For higher-value purchases

```javascript
// E-commerce payment method selection
const getRecommendedMethods = (orderAmount, customerProfile) => {
  const methods = ['CARD']; // Always include cards
  
  if (orderAmount > 500) {
    methods.push('SPEI'); // SPEI for higher amounts
  }
  
  if (customerProfile.prefersCash) {
    methods.push('OXXO'); // Cash option
  }
  
  if (customerProfile.age < 35) {
    methods.push('MERCADOPAGO'); // Digital wallet for younger users
  }
  
  return methods;
};
```

### For B2B Platforms

**Primary recommendation:**
1. **SPEI Bank Transfers** - Preferred for business transactions
2. **Card Payments** - For smaller purchases and international cards

### For Cash-Heavy Markets

**Primary recommendation:**
1. **OXXO Cash Payments** - Widest store coverage in Mexico
2. **SafetyPay** - Alternative for regions without OXXO
3. **Card Payments** - For customers with cards

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Start with Core Methods

Begin with the most essential payment methods for your market:

<Steps>
<Step title="Implement card payments first">
Cards provide immediate confirmation and work for most customers.
</Step>
<Step title="Add OXXO for cash payments">
Essential for the Mexican market where cash is still popular.
</Step>
<Step title="Consider SPEI for higher amounts">
Bank transfers are trusted for larger transactions.
</Step>
<Step title="Expand based on customer feedback">
Add digital wallets and alternative methods based on demand.
</Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Design Your Payment Flow

```javascript
// Example: Multi-method payment selector
class PaymentMethodSelector {
  constructor(orderAmount, customerLocation) {
    this.amount = orderAmount;
    this.location = customerLocation;
  }
  
  getAvailableMethods() {
    const methods = [
      {
        type: 'CARD',
        name: 'Tarjeta de crédito/débito',
        processingTime: 'Inmediato',
        icon: 'credit-card',
        recommended: true
      },
      {
        type: 'OXXO', 
        name: 'Pago en OXXO',
        processingTime: '24-48 horas',
        icon: 'store',
        description: 'Paga en efectivo en cualquier OXXO'
      }
    ];
    
    if (this.amount >= 500) {
      methods.push({
        type: 'SPEI',
        name: 'Transferencia bancaria',
        processingTime: 'Inmediato',
        icon: 'bank',
        description: 'Transfiere desde tu banca en línea'
      });
    }
    
    return methods;
  }
}
```

### 3. Handle Different Response Types

Different payment methods have different response patterns:

```javascript
// Handle various payment method responses
const handlePaymentResponse = (response, paymentType) => {
  switch (paymentType) {
    case 'CARD':
      if (response.status === 'authorized') {
        showSuccessPage(response);
      } else if (response.next_action) {
        // Handle 3DS redirect
        redirectTo3DS(response.next_action.redirect_to_url.url);
      }
      break;
      
    case 'OXXO':
    case 'SAFETYPAY':
      // Show payment voucher
      displayCashVoucher(response.payment_instructions);
      break;
      
    case 'SPEI':
      // Show bank transfer instructions
      displayBankInstructions(response.payment_instructions);
      break;
      
    case 'MERCADOPAGO':
      // Redirect to Mercado Pago
      redirectToWallet(response.next_action.redirect_to_url.url);
      break;
  }
};
```

## Best Practices for Multiple Payment Methods

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="User Experience">
- Show processing times clearly for each method
- Recommend payment methods based on order amount and customer profile
- Provide fallbacks when preferred methods fail
- Maintain consistent UI across all payment methods
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Technical Implementation">
- Use the same endpoint for all payment methods (`/process/`)
- Implement proper error handling for each method type
- Set up webhooks to track asynchronous payments (OXXO, SPEI, SafetyPay)
- Store payment method preferences for returning customers
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Business Strategy">
- Analyze payment method performance (success rates, customer preference)
- Optimize for your customer base (age, location, transaction size)
- Monitor abandonment rates by payment method
- Test different payment method orders in your checkout flow
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Monitoring and Analytics

Track these metrics for each payment method:

```javascript
const trackPaymentMethod = (method, action, metadata = {}) => {
  analytics.track('payment_method_interaction', {
    method: method,
    action: action, // 'selected', 'completed', 'failed'
    amount: metadata.amount,
    customer_segment: metadata.segment,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
};

// Usage examples
trackPaymentMethod('CARD', 'selected', { amount: 150, segment: 'returning' });
trackPaymentMethod('OXXO', 'completed', { amount: 250, segment: 'new' });
```
