## When to Use SPEI

SPEI (Sistema de Pagos Electrónicos Interbancarios) is Mexico's real-time bank transfer system, perfect for:
- Higher-value transactions (B2B payments).
- Customers who prefer bank transfers over cards.
- Transactions requiring immediate processing during business hours.
- Reducing card processing fees for large amounts.

## Step 1: Create a SPEI Payment Request

Creating a SPEI payment request is straightforward since SPEI doesn't require additional customer data beyond basic information. The [API](/reference/overview) will generate payment instructions for your customer.

```json
{
  "operation_type": "payment",
  "amount": 500.00,
  "currency": "MXN",
  "customer": {
    "name": "Carlos Eduardo López",
    "email": "carlos.lopez@empresa.mx"
  },
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "SPEI"
  },
  "client_reference": "invoice-456"
}
```

## Step 2: Send the Payment Request

Send your payment request to the [Process Transaction](/reference/process-transaction) endpoint to initiate the SPEI transfer:

```bash
curl -X POST https://stage.tonder.io/api/v1/process/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "operation_type": "payment",
    "amount": 500.00,
    "currency": "MXN",
    "customer": {
      "name": "Carlos Eduardo López",
      "email": "carlos.lopez@empresa.mx"
    },
    "payment_method": {
      "type": "SPEI"
    },
    "client_reference": "invoice-456"
  }'
```

## Step 3: Handle the Response

The [API](/reference/overview) response will include payment instructions and status information. SPEI payments always start with a `pending` status since they require the customer to complete the bank transfer.

```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "operation_type": "payment",
  "status": "pending",
  "amount": 500.00,
  "currency": "MXN",
  "payment_instructions": {
    "bank_account": "123456789012345678",
    "bank_name": "Banco Receptor",
    "reference": "SPEI789456123",
    "instructions": [
      "Realiza una transferencia SPEI a la cuenta indicada",
      "Usa la referencia proporcionada",
      "El pago será procesado inmediatamente"
    ]
  },
  "created_at": "2024-07-26T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Step 4: Provide Instructions to Your Customer

Present the payment instructions clearly to help customers complete their bank transfer successfully:

<Steps>
<Step title="Share the bank account details">
Provide the `bank_account` number and `bank_name` from the response.
</Step>
<Step title="Provide the payment reference">
Give the customer the `reference` number - this is crucial for payment identification.
</Step>
<Step title="Set expectations">
Explain that SPEI transfers are processed in real-time during operating hours.
</Step>
<Step title="Monitor payment status">
Use [webhooks](/direct-integration/webhooks/how-webhooks-works) or polling to track when the payment is completed.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 5: Track Payment Status

Monitor the payment status to know when the transfer is completed. SPEI payments follow this status flow:

1. `pending` - Waiting for customer to make transfer
2. `processing` - Bank transfer in progress  
3. `success` - Payment completed successfully

[Webhooks](/direct-integration/webhooks/how-webhooks-works) provide real-time notifications when payment status changes. Set up webhooks to receive status updates automatically:

```json
{
  "event": "payment.status_changed",
  "data": {
    "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "status": "success",
    "amount": 500.00,
    "completed_at": "2024-07-26T10:45:00Z"
  }
}
```

Alternatively, poll the transaction status using the [Get Transaction Status](/reference/get-transaction-status) endpoint:

```bash
curl -X GET https://stage.tonder.io/api/v1/transactions/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Step 6: Handle SPEI-Specific Scenarios
