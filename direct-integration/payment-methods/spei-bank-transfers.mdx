---

This guide shows you how to accept SPEI (Sistema de Pagos Electrónicos Interbancarios) bank transfers in Mexico. SPEI enables real-time bank-to-bank transfers and is perfect for higher-value transactions where customers prefer bank payments.

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:
- A Tonder account configured for Mexico
- Your API credentials set up
- Understanding that SPEI payments are asynchronous (require customer action)

## When to Use SPEI

SPEI is ideal for:
- Higher-value transactions (B2B payments)
- Customers who prefer bank transfers over cards
- Transactions requiring immediate processing during business hours
- Reducing card processing fees for large amounts

## 1. Create a SPEI Payment Request

SPEI payments are simple to set up - you only need to specify the payment type. The API will generate payment instructions for your customer.

```json
{
  "operation_type": "payment",
  "amount": 500.00,
  "currency": "MXN",
  "customer": {
    "name": "Carlos Eduardo López",
    "email": "carlos.lopez@empresa.mx"
  },
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "SPEI"
  },
  "client_reference": "invoice-456"
}
```

## 2. Send the Payment Request

Make a POST request to create the SPEI payment:

```bash
curl -X POST https://stage.tonder.io/api/v1/process/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "operation_type": "payment",
    "amount": 500.00,
    "currency": "MXN",
    "customer": {
      "name": "Carlos Eduardo López",
      "email": "carlos.lopez@empresa.mx"
    },
    "payment_method": {
      "type": "SPEI"
    },
    "client_reference": "invoice-456"
  }'
```

## 3. Handle the Response

SPEI payments always start with a `pending` status since they require the customer to complete the bank transfer.

```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "operation_type": "payment",
  "status": "pending",
  "amount": 500.00,
  "currency": "MXN",
  "payment_instructions": {
    "bank_account": "123456789012345678",
    "bank_name": "Banco Receptor",
    "reference": "SPEI789456123",
    "instructions": [
      "Realiza una transferencia SPEI a la cuenta indicada",
      "Usa la referencia proporcionada",
      "El pago será procesado inmediatamente"
    ]
  },
  "created_at": "2024-07-26T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## 4. Provide Instructions to Your Customer

After receiving the response, display clear instructions to your customer:

<Steps>
<Step title="Share the bank account details">
Provide the `bank_account` number and `bank_name` from the response.
</Step>
<Step title="Provide the payment reference">
Give the customer the `reference` number - this is crucial for payment identification.
</Step>
<Step title="Set expectations">
Explain that SPEI transfers are processed in real-time during operating hours.
</Step>
<Step title="Monitor payment status">
Use webhooks or polling to track when the payment is completed.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Customer Instructions Template

```
Para completar tu pago de $500.00 MXN:

1. Ingresa a tu banca en línea o app bancaria
2. Realiza una transferencia SPEI a:
   - Cuenta: 123456789012345678
   - Banco: Banco Receptor
   - Referencia: SPEI789456123
3. Tu pago será procesado inmediatamente

Conserva tu comprobante de transferencia.
```

## 5. Track Payment Status

SPEI payments follow this status flow:

1. **`pending`** - Waiting for customer to make transfer
2. **`processing`** - Bank transfer in progress  
3. **`success`** - Payment completed successfully

### Using Webhooks (Recommended)

Set up a webhook to receive status updates automatically:

```json
{
  "event": "payment.status_changed",
  "data": {
    "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "status": "success",
    "amount": 500.00,
    "completed_at": "2024-07-26T10:45:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Using Status Polling

Alternatively, poll the transaction status:

```bash
curl -X GET https://stage.tonder.io/api/v1/transactions/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## 6. Handle SPEI-Specific Scenarios

There are some specificities to consider when using SPEI payments:

### Operating Hours

SPEI operates 24/7, but some banks may have their own restrictions:

- Most transfers process immediately
- Some banks may batch transfers during off-hours
- Transfers between participating banks are typically instant

### Amount Limits

Regarding the amount limits, SPEI has the following restrictions:
- Minimum: Usually $1 MXN
- Maximum: Varies by bank (commonly $8,000,000 MXN per day)
- No Tonder-imposed limits on SPEI amounts

### Common Errors

Some common errors that may occur when using SPEI payments are:

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `invalid_amount` | Amount exceeds bank limits | Use smaller amount or split transaction |
| `spei_unavailable` | Temporary service issue | Retry later or offer alternative payment |

## Implementation Tips

Follow the best practices below to integrate SPEI payments:

- Make bank transfer steps obvious to customers
- Set up webhooks instead of relying on polling for status updates
- Consider payments abandoned after 24-48 hours
- Allow customers to upload transfer receipts
- Provide backup payment methods for failed transfers
