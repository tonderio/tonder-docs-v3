---

This guide explains how to send payouts, or withdrawals, to beneficiaries using the Tonder API. Withdrawals are processed through the same unified `/process/` endpoint as payments, by setting the `operation_type` to `"withdrawal"`.

<Note>
**Availability Notice**

Withdrawals are currently only available for beneficiaries in Mexico. Support for additional countries will be added in future releases.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have API credentials from Tonder (available in your [Dashboard → Developers → API Keys](https://app.tonder.io/accounts/login/)).

<Info>
**Available Transfer Methods**

There are two transfer methods available:

- SPEI: Bank transfers processed same business day during banking hours
- Debit Card: Instant deposits available within 5-15 minutes, 24/7
</Info>

## 1. Prepare Your Withdrawal Request

Create your withdrawal request using the [`/process/`](/reference/process-transaction) endpoint with `operation_type` set to `"withdrawal"`.

Here's the standard format for withdrawal requests:

```json
{
  "operation_type": "withdrawal",
  "amount": 750.00,
  "currency": "MXN",
  "reference": "your-internal-payout-id-001",
  "description": "Commission payment for July",
  "transfer_method": "SPEI", // or "DEBIT_CARD"
  "beneficiary": {
    "account": "012345678901234567", // CLABE for SPEI, Card Number for DEBIT_CARD
    "name": "Roberto Martínez García",
    "rfc": "MAGR850920XY1",
    "institution": "40012",
    "email": "roberto.martinez@email.com"
  }
}
```

The request must have the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `operation_type` | Always set to `"withdrawal"` for payout operations |
| `amount` | The withdrawal amount in the specified currency |
| `currency` | Currency code (currently only `"MXN"` is supported) |
| `transfer_method` | Either `"SPEI"` or `"DEBIT_CARD"` |
| `beneficiary` | Complete beneficiary information object |

The `beneficiary` object in the request is made up of the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `account` | The destination account number (18-digit CLABE for SPEI transfers, or 16-digit card number for debit card deposits) |
| `name` | Full legal name of the beneficiary as it appears on their bank account or card |
| `rfc` | Mexican tax identification number (RFC) - required for compliance and verification |
| `institution` | Bank institution code (you can find codes in our [Mexican Banking Reference](/direct-integration/reference/mexican-banking-reference)) |
| `email` | Beneficiary's email address for notifications and record-keeping |

## 2. Choose Your Transfer Method

Select the transfer method that fits your payout needs. Here you can find a quick comparison between the two methods:

| Aspect | SPEI | Debit Card |
|--------|------|------------|
| **Processing Time** | Same business day | 5-15 minutes |
| **Availability** | Banking hours only | 24/7 |
| **Account Type** | 18-digit CLABE | 16-digit card number |
| **Best For** | Regular payments, larger amounts | Urgent payments, instant cashouts |

### SPEI Bank Transfer

SPEI (Sistema de Pagos Electrónicos Interbancarios) is Mexico's standard electronic payment system for bank-to-bank transfers.

You should use SPEI when:
- Making regular business payments like commissions or vendor payments
- Processing payroll and salary transfers
- Sending larger amounts where cost-effectiveness is important
- Same-day processing during business hours is acceptable

<Info>
**Key requirements**

Pay attention to the following specifics for SPEI withdrawals:
- The `transfer_method` value must be `"SPEI"`
- The `beneficiary.account` must be a valid 18-digit CLABE (Clave Bancaria Estandarizada)
- Processing occurs during banking hours (typically 9 AM - 5 PM MXT, Monday-Friday)
</Info>

Here's an example of a request to withdraw funds using SPEI:

```json
{
  "operation_type": "withdrawal",
  "amount": 750.00,
  "currency": "MXN",
  "reference": "payout-001",
  "transfer_method": "SPEI",
  "description": "Commission payment",
  "beneficiary": {
    "account": "012345678901234567", // 18-digit CLABE
    "name": "Roberto Martínez García",
    "rfc": "MAGR850920XY1",
    "institution": "40012",
    "email": "roberto.martinez@email.com"
  }
}
```

### Debit Card Instant Transfer

Debit card withdrawals provide near-instant fund delivery directly to the beneficiary's debit card.

You should use Debit Card withdrawals when:
- Making urgent or emergency payments that can't wait for business hours
- Paying gig economy workers who need immediate access to funds
- Providing instant cashouts or on-demand withdrawals
- Processing customer refunds that require immediate availability

<Info>
**Key requirements**

Pay attention to the following specifics for debit card withdrawals:

- The `transfer_method` value must be `"DEBIT_CARD"`
- The `beneficiary.account` must be a valid 16-digit debit card number
- Processing occurs 24/7, including weekends and holidays
- Funds are typically available within 5-15 minutes
</Info>

Here's an example of a request to withdraw funds using debit card:

```json
{
  "operation_type": "withdrawal",
  "amount": 500.00,
  "currency": "MXN",
  "reference": "card-payout-002",
  "transfer_method": "DEBIT_CARD",
  "description": "Instant payout to debit card",
  "beneficiary": {
    "account": "4111111111111111", // 16-digit card number
    "name": "Ana María González",
    "rfc": "GOAN850315AB2",
    "institution": "40012",
    "email": "ana.gonzalez@email.com"
  }
}
```

## 3. Send the Withdrawal Request

Make a POST request to the [`/process/`](/reference/process-transaction) endpoint with your withdrawal data:

```bash
curl -X POST https://stage.tonder.io/api/v1/process/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "operation_type": "withdrawal",
    "amount": 750.00,
    "currency": "MXN",
    "reference": "payout-001",
    "transfer_method": "SPEI",
    "description": "Commission payment",
    "beneficiary": {
      "account": "012345678901234567",
      "name": "Roberto Martínez García",
      "rfc": "MAGR850920XY1",
      "institution": "40012",
      "email": "roberto.martinez@email.com"
    }
  }'
```

## 4. Handle the Response

Upon successful request, the API will return an immediate acknowledgment. Here you find a description of the fields in the response:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `id` | Unique transaction identifier |
| `operation_type` | Confirms this is a withdrawal operation |
| `status` | Current transaction status (initially `processing`) |
| `amount` | Withdrawal amount as submitted |
| `currency` | Currency code |
| `merchant_reference` | Your internal reference identifier |
| `created_at` | ISO 8601 timestamp when the withdrawal was created |
| `status_code` | HTTP status code (201 for successful creation) |

The response structure is as follows:

```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001",
  "operation_type": "withdrawal",
  "status": "processing",
  "amount": 750.00,
  "currency": "MXN",
  "merchant_reference": "payout-001",
  "created_at": "2024-07-26T10:30:00Z",
  "status_code": 201
}
```

After receiving the response, save the transaction ID from the `id` field to monitor progress.

As your withdrawal progresses, it will move through different statuses. Here's what each status means and what you should do:

| Status | Description | Next Steps |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| `pending` | The withdrawal request has been received and is queued | Monitor for status change |
| `processing` | The transfer is currently being processed by the bank | Wait for completion |
| `success` | The transfer was completed successfully | The transaction is complete |
| `failed` | The transfer failed due to a processing or system error | Check the error details and retry if appropriate |
| `declined` | The transfer was declined by the bank (e.g., invalid account) | Correct beneficiary data and create a new withdrawal |

## 5. Monitor Withdrawal Progress

Since withdrawals are asynchronous operations, you need to monitor the transaction to check the final status (`success`, `failed`, or `declined`). For this, you must use the transaction `id`from the repsponse. Set up status monitoring using one of these methods:

### Option A: Webhooks (Recommended)

Configure [webhooks](/direct-integration/webhooks/how-webhooks-works) to receive real-time status updates automatically.

### Option B: Status Polling

Check transaction status periodically using the [`/transactions/{withdrawal_id}/`](/reference/get-transaction-status) endpoint:

## Next Steps

- Set up [webhooks](/direct-integration/webhooks/how-webhooks-works) to receive real-time notifications when withdrawal statuses change
- Learn about [HTTP response codes](/direct-integration/http-response-codes) to understand how to handle different API responses and error scenarios
- Explore [rate limits](/direct-integration/rate-limits) to ensure your withdrawal processing doesn't exceed API usage limits
