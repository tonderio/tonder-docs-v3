sidebarTitle: "PCI Compliant Raw Card Processing"
---

This guide shows you how to process payments directly with raw card data without tokenization. This approach is designed for merchants who already have full PCI DSS Level 1 compliance and want to eliminate the multi-step tokenization process.

<Warning>
**Availability Restriction**

This process is only available for clients who are fully PCI DSS compliant. You must maintain enterprise-grade security and handle raw card data according to all PCI DSS requirements.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have full PCI DSS Level 1 certification, which is mandatory for handling raw card data.

<Info>
**When to Use This Approach**

Raw card processing is recommended for:
- Large enterprise merchants already PCI Level 1 certified.
- Payment processors operating under existing PCI compliance.
- High-volume businesses with existing PCI infrastructure.
- Systems where reduced latency is critical.

It is not recommended for:
- Small to medium businesses without PCI compliance.
- New payment integrations.
- Cost-conscious merchants (compliance maintenance is expensive).
</Info>

## Step 1: Configure API Authentication

Configure your authentication headers to access the PCI-compliant processing endpoints.

Include these headers in every request:

```http
Authorization: Token <YOUR_API_KEY>
Content-Type: application/json
```

## Step 2: Process the Payment

Send a POST request with raw card data directly to the PCI compliant endpoint.

The request structure is identical to the [standard process endpoint](/direct-integration/guides/create-payments/create-a-payment), but with raw card data.

<Info>
For testing, use the card numbers and test data available in our [Testing Data guide](/direct-integration/testing-data) to ensure your integration works correctly before going live.
</Info>

Send a `POST` request to the [Process Transaction](/reference/process-transaction) endpoint with the required parameters below:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| operation_type | string | Must be `"payment"` to process a payment |
| amount | number | Payment amount (e.g., `150.00`) |
| currency | string | Currency code (e.g., `"MXN"` for Mexican Peso) |
| customer | object | Customer information containing `name` and `email` |
| payment_method | object | Payment method details including `type` and raw card information |
| client_reference | string | Your unique reference for this transaction |
| return_url | string | URL where customer returns after 3DS authentication |

Here's an example of a request with raw card data:

```bash cURL Example
curl -X POST https://process-sandbox.tonder.io/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token 04fbdd63113c009b6ac14c7d230b13909ae11221" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "operation_type": "payment",
    "amount": 150.00,
    "currency": "MXN",
    "customer": {
      "name": "Ana María Rodríguez",
      "email": "ana.rodriguez@email.com"
    },
    "payment_method": {
      "type": "CARD",
      "card_number": "4444444444444455",
      "cardholder_name": "Ana María Rodríguez",
      "cvv": "123",
      "expiration_year": "26",
      "expiration_month": "07"
    },
    "client_reference": "order-789",
    "return_url": "https://mystore.com/payment/return"
  }'
```

## Step 4: Handle the Response

Process the payment response according to the status received. The API returns a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "amount": 150,
  "client_reference": "order-789",
  "created_at": "2025-09-04T23:03:33.778574Z",
  "currency": "MXN",
  "id": "2fd6a7fa-2997-434d-a8e0-1128cf7d00a3",
  "next_action": {
    "redirect_to_url": {
      "return_url": "https://mystore.com/payment/return?tndr_payment_id=45396",
      "url": "https://sandbox.cardpay.com/MI/payments/redirect?token=9e53b5de-76d5-4c59-82a8-09ad4e87f42a",
      "verify_transaction_status_url": "/transactions/2fd6a7fa-2997-434d-a8e0-1128cf7d00a3/"
    }
  },
  "operation_type": "payment",
  "payment_id": 45396,
  "provider": "tonder",
  "status": "Pending",
  "status_code": 201,
  "transaction_id": 8707
}
```

In this example, the payment is **pending** and requires 3DS authentication. Always check the `status` field in your response and implement appropriate logic based on the status value received.

The table below details the fields that are returned in the response:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Unique transaction identifier |
| `operation_type` | string | Always `"payment"` |
| `status` | string | Transaction status |
| `amount` | decimal | Transaction amount |
| `currency` | string | Currency code |
| `client_reference` | string | Your reference identifier |
| `payment_id` | integer | Internal payment ID |
| `transaction_id` | integer | Internal transaction ID |
| `provider` | string | Payment provider used |
| `created_at` | string | ISO 8601 timestamp |
| `status_code` | integer | HTTP status code |
| `next_action` | object | Required actions (3DS, redirects) |

<Warning>
**Validation of `id` and `status` fields**

For proper payment validation, you must check:
- `id` is the unique transaction identifier - store this for future reference.
- `status` is the current payment state - determines next actions.

Never rely on HTTP status codes alone for payment validation.
</Warning>

## Next Steps

After implementing PCI compliant raw card processing:

- Set up [webhooks](/direct-integration/webhooks/how-webhooks-works) for real-time payment status updates.
- Implement [3D Secure authentication](/direct-integration/guides/create-payments/create-a-payment-with-3ds) for enhanced security.
- Review [HTTP response codes](/direct-integration/http-response-codes) for comprehensive error handling.
- Test your implementation using [testing data](/direct-integration/testing-data).
