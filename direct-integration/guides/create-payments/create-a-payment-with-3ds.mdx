---

3D Secure (3DS) is an authentication protocol that adds an extra layer of security to online card payments. It helps prevent fraud by verifying the cardholder's identity, often through a code sent to their phone or a prompt in their banking app.

When a card-issuing bank requires this extra verification, the Tonder API will respond with a special `next_action` object, telling you how to proceed.

## The 3DS Payment Flow

Here is the visual representation of the flow for a payment that requires 3D Secure authentication:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as Customer
    participant App as Your Application
    participant Tonder as Tonder API
    participant Bank as Customer's Bank
    
    User->>App: Initiates payment
    App->>Tonder: POST /process/ (card payment)
    
    Note over Tonder: Detects 3DS requirement
    
    Tonder->>App: 202 Pending + next_action.redirect_to_url
    
    Note over App: Save transaction ID for later status check
    
    App->>User: Redirect to 3DS URL
    User->>Bank: Complete authentication challenge
    
    Note over Bank: Customer enters OTP or biometric
    
    Bank->>User: Redirect back to return_url
    User->>App: Returns to your application
    
    App->>Tonder: GET /transactions/{id}/ (check final status)
    Tonder->>App: Final status (success/failed)
    
    App->>User: Show payment confirmation
```

This asynchronous flow requires you to handle redirects and check the final transaction status after the customer completes authentication.

## 1. Initiating the Payment

The initial request follows the same structure as a standard card payment, but it's crucial to include a `return_url` so the customer can be redirected back to your site after completing the 3DS challenge.

This request initiates the payment and triggers the 3DS check if required by the customer's bank:

```json Initial Request
{
  "operation_type": "payment",
  "amount": 150.00,
  "currency": "MXN",
  "customer": {
    "name": "Test Customer",
    "email": "test@example.com"
  },
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "CARD",
    "card_number": "4000000000000119" // Test card that triggers 3DS
  },
  "client_reference": "order-3ds-test-001",
  "return_url": "https://your-store.com/payment/complete"
}
```

## 2. Handling the `next_action` Response

If 3DS authentication is required, the API will respond with a `status` of `pending` and a `next_action` object containing the redirect URL for the customer's authentication.

<Warning>
**Important: Save the transaction ID**

You must save the `id` from this response as you'll need it later to check the final payment status after the customer completes the 3DS challenge.
</Warning>

Here's an example of the response when 3DS is required:

```json Next Action Response
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "operation_type": "payment",
  "status": "pending",
  "amount": 150.00,
  "currency": "MXN",
  "next_action": {
    "redirect_to_url": {
      "url": "https://secure.payment-provider.com/3ds/abc123",
      "return_url": "https://your-store.com/payment/complete",
      "verify_transaction_status_url": "/api/v1/stripe/business/123/payments/456/transactions/789"
    }
  },
  "created_at": "2024-07-26T10:30:00Z",
  "status_code": 202
}
```

When you receive a response with `next_action`, you need to:

1. Store the `responseData.id` for later status verification
2. Check for the redirect URL in `next_action.redirect_to_url.url` 
3. Redirect the customer to complete the 3DS challenge

The following JavaScript code demonstrates how to handle the API response, determine if 3DS authentication is required, save the transaction ID for later use, and redirect the customer to their bank's authentication page when necessary:

```javascript
// Example client-side JavaScript to handle the redirect
const responseData = { /* The JSON response from the API */ };

// CRITICAL: Save the transaction ID for later status check
const transactionId = responseData.id;
localStorage.setItem('pendingTransactionId', transactionId);

if (responseData.next_action && responseData.next_action.redirect_to_url) {
  // Redirect the user to their bank's 3DS authentication page
  window.location.href = responseData.next_action.redirect_to_url.url;
} else {
  // Handle final status (e.g., authorized, declined) for non-3DS payments
  console.log('Payment completed with status:', responseData.status);
}
```

## 3. Verifying the Final Status

Once the customer completes the 3DS challenge, their bank will redirect them back to the `return_url` you provided.

At this point, the transaction has been processed, but you still need to get its final status. Use the transaction `id` that you saved from the initial response to query the [Get Transaction Status](/reference/get-transaction-status) endpoint:

```bash
curl -X GET https://stage.tonder.io/api/v1/transactions/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000/ \
-H "Authorization: Token <YOUR_SANDBOX_API_KEY>"
```

The response will show the final status of the transaction after 3DS completion:

```json Final Status Response
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "operation_type": "payment",
  "status": "success",
  "amount": 150.00,
  "currency": "MXN",
  "merchant_reference": "order-3ds-test-001",
  "created_at": "2024-07-26T10:30:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2024-07-26T10:32:15Z",
  "completion_details": {
    "completed_at": "2024-07-26T10:32:15Z",
    "authorization_code": "AUTH123456"
  }
}
```

You can now confidently update the order status in your system and show the customer a confirmation page.

<Tip>
While polling the status endpoint after the redirect works, the best practice is to use **[Webhooks](/direct-integration/webhooks/how-webhooks-works)**. A webhook will proactively notify your server as soon as the final status is available, providing a more efficient and reliable update mechanism.
