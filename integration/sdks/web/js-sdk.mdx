---

The Tonder JS SDK is a vanilla Javascript solution for integrating our system into your platform. This solution ensures PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) by securely collecting and tokenizing sensitive data in the browser, without exposing your front-end infrastructure to any sensitive data.

This guide will walk you through all the steps, from installation and configuring to styling the SDK to fit your website.

## Installation

Tonder gives you two ways to install our SDK. You can install our npm package or use script tags directly in your HTML.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="NPM Package">
    To install [Tonder's SDK with npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tonder-web-sdk), use the following command:

    ```curl
    npm i tonder-web-sdk
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Script tag">
    To use Tonder's SDK through script tag, add the following to your HTML:

    ```html
    <script src="https://zplit-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/v1/bundle.min.js"></script>
    ```
  </Accordion> 
</AccordionGroup>

## Requirements

To configure our SDK you need to add the following script tags to your HTML:

```html
<script src="https://js.skyflow.com/v1/index.js"></script>
<script src="https://openpay.s3.amazonaws.com/openpay.v1.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://openpay.s3.amazonaws.com/openpay-data.v1.min.js"></script>
```

The first tag is mandatory for achieving PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), as stated at the top of this page, by using Skyflows's integration. The other tags are necessary to ensure a reliable connection to the payment processor.

<Note>You can also install each one with their respective npm packages</Note>
