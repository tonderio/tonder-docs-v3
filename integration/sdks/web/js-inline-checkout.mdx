Tonder's JS SDK Inline Checkout brings you a easy to integrate, pre-built, customizable interface. This guide will take you step-by-step into integrating it.

<Info>
  If you haven't installed and pre-configured Tonder's JS SDK, refer to the [Installation guide here](/integration/sdks/web/js-sdk).
</Info>

## Configuration

Before initializing an instance of Tonder SDK, ensure that you have configured it properly. Follow the usage example below:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the required ID to your HTML">
    Tonder's JS SDK needs an entry point to operate. This entry point is defined by adding a `tonder-checkout` ID to an empty `div`, like the example below:

    ```html
    <div>
        <h1>Checkout</h1>
        <!-- You have to add an entry point with the ID 'tonder-checkout' -->
        <div id="tonder-checkout">
        </div>
    </div>
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize Tonder's SDK Instance">
    Initialize Tonder's JS SDK instance with the following parameters:

| Field            | Description                                                   |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `mode`           | Environment mode. Options: `stage`, `production`, `sandbox`. Default: `stage` |
| `apiKey`         | The API key used for authentication and authorization.        |
| `returnUrl`      | The URL to which the user is redirected after the checkout process, regardless of success or failure. |
| `customization`  | This object is designed to customize the behavior of the checkout. It is used to adjust both the interface options and operational parameters. Refer to the [Customizations](#customizations) section for more details. |
| `styles`         | Custom styles object that allows you to customize the appearance of the inline checkout. It may include properties such as colors, fonts, and other styling options. Refer to the [Styling](#styling) section for more details. |

    <CodeGroup>

    ```javascript npm package option
    import { InlineCheckout } from "tonder-web-sdk";

    const inlineCheckout = new InlineCheckout({
      apiKey,
      returnUrl,
      styles: customStyles,
      customization
    });
    ```
    ```javascript Script tag option
    const inlineCheckout = new TonderSdk.InlineCheckout({
      apiKey,
      returnUrl,
      styles: customStyles,
      customization
    });
    ```

    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure checkout method (Optional)">
    You can use the `configureCheckout` method to set initial customer information, such as their email address, allowing to retrieve the respectives user's saved cards. 

    ```javascript
    inlineCheckout.configureCheckout({ customer: { email: "example@email.com" } });
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Inject checkout method">
    Call the `injectCheckout` method with your inlineCheckout instance, with the code below:

    ```javascript
    inlineCheckout.injectCheckout();
    ```

    This method will use the element with id `tonder-checkout` added in Step 1 to render the checkout elements, as exemplified by the image below:

    <Frame>![](/images/SDKs/checkout-gif.gif)</Frame>

    With this, you can render the checkout to your customers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add 3DS verification">
    Use Tonder's SDK `verify3dsTransaction()` method to validate if the 3DS challenge was successful or not. Use the example below to call the method and handle the response as needed:

    ```js
    inlineCheckout.verify3dsTransaction().then(response => {
      console.log('Verify 3ds response', response);
      
      if (response.transaction_status === 'Success') {
        alert('3DS Transaction verified.');
        // Proceed with normal payment flow
      } else if (response.transaction_status === 'Failed') {
        alert('3DS Transaction Failed');
      }
    });
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a pay button">
    Lastly, you need to create a button to submit the form. This button needs to have an event listener that calls the `payment` method from the `inlineCheckout` instance, sending the checkout data as payload, like presented below:

    ```javascript
    document.getElementById('your-pay-button').addEventListener('click', async () => {
      try {
        response = await inlineCheckout.payment(checkoutData);
        if (response.transaction_status === 'Success') {
          alert('Payment successful.');
        } else if (response.transaction_status === 'Pending') {
          alert('Payment pending. Redirecting to 3DS...');
          // The redirection to 3DS occurs automatically
        } else {
          alert('Payment declined.');
        }
      } catch (error) {
        alert('Error with payment.');
      }
    });
    ```

    #### Checkout data

    The payment function payload needs to be an object with detailed information about the customer, currency and cart. Below you find details abou each needed field:
