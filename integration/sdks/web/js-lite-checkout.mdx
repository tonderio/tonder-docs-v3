Tonder's JS SDK Lite Checkout gives you freedom to build your own checkout interface while taking advantage of our core functionalities. This guide will take you step-by-step into integrating it.

<Info>
  If you haven't installed and pre-configured Tonder's JS SDK, refer to the [Installation guide here](/integration/sdks/web/js-sdk).
</Info>

## Configuration

Before initializing an instance of Tonder SDK, ensure that you have configured it properly. Follow the usage example below:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the required ID to your HTML">
    Tonder's JS SDK needs an entry point to operate. This entry point is defined by adding a `tonder-checkout` ID to an empty `div`, like the example below:

    ```html
    <div>
        <h1>Checkout</h1>
        <!-- You have to add an entry point with the ID 'tonder-checkout' -->
        <div id="tonder-checkout">
        </div>
    </div>
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize Tonder's SDK Instance">
    Initialize Tonder's JS SDK instance with the following parameters:

| Field            | Description                                                   |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `mode`           | Environment mode. Options: `stage`, `production`, `sandbox`. Default: `stage` |
| `apiKey`         | The API key used for authentication and authorization.        |
| `returnUrl`      | The URL to which the user is redirected after the checkout process, regardless of success or failure. |
| `customization`  | This object is designed to customize the behavior of the checkout. It is used to adjust both the interface options and operational parameters. Refer to the [Customizations](#customizations) section for more details. |
| `styles`         | Custom styles object that allows you to customize the appearance of the inline checkout. It may include properties such as colors, fonts, and other styling options. Refer to the [Styling](#styling) section for more details. |

    <CodeGroup>

    ```javascript npm package option
    import { LiteCheckout } from "tonder-web-sdk";

    const liteCheckout = new LiteCheckout({
      apiKey,
      returnUrl,
      styles: customStyles,
      customization
    });
    ```
    ```javascript Script tag option
    const liteCheckout = new TonderSdk.LiteCheckout({
      apiKey,
      returnUrl,
      styles: customStyles,
      customization
    });
    ```

    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure checkout method (Optional)">
    You can use the `configureCheckout` method to set initial customer information, such as their email address, allowing to retrieve the respectives user's saved cards. 

    ```javascript
    liteCheckout.configureCheckout({ customer: { email: "example@email.com" } });
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Inject checkout method">
    Call the `injectCheckout` method with your inlineCheckout instance, with the code below:

    ```javascript
    liteCheckout.injectCheckout();
    ```

    <Frame>![](/images/SDKs/checkout-gif.gif)</Frame>

    With this, you can render the checkout to your customers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a pay button">
    Lastly, you need to create a button to submit the form. This button needs to have an event listener that calls the `payment` method from the `liteCheckout` instance, sending the checkout data as payload, like presented below:

    ```javascript
    document.getElementById('your-pay-button').addEventListener('click', async () => {
      try {
        response = await liteCheckout.payment(checkoutData);
        if (response.transaction_status === 'Success') {
          alert('Payment successful.');
        } else if (response.transaction_status === 'Pending') {
          alert('Payment pending. Redirecting to 3DS...');
          // The redirection to 3DS occurs automatically
        } else {
          alert('Payment declined.');
        }
      } catch (error) {
        alert('Error with payment.');
      }
    });
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

After Completing these steps, you can use the [Lite Checkout available methods](#class-methods) to manage your user's experience.

## Class Methods

With your Lite Checkout instance configured, you'll have at your disposal the following methods:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Cards" href="#cards" />
  <Card title="Get Customer Payment Methods" href="#get-customer-payment-methods" />
  <Card title="Payment" href="href" />
  <Card title="3DS Verification" href="#3ds-verification" />
</CardGroup>

### Cards

Tonderâ€™s SDK offers the following methods to manage customer cards:

- `getCustomerCards`
- `saveCustomerCard`
- `removeCustomerCard`

<Warning>You need to use the `secureToken` to be able to manage cards with Tonder's SDK. Refer to the [How to Use secureToken for Secure Card Saving](/integration/sdks/secure-token) to learn how to do this.</Warning>

#### Get Customer Cards

Use the `getCustomerCards` method to retrieve previously saved customer cards:

```js
const cards = await liteCheckout.getCustomerCards();
```

#### Save Customer Card

Use the `saveCustomerCard` method to save a new card into the system. This method requires an object as parameter to define the card's properties:

Sure! Here's a markdown table with the keys and their descriptions:

| Key               | Description                                       |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `card_number`   | The credit card number without spaces or dashes.  |
| `cvv`           | The card verification value, a 3 or 4-digit code. |
| `expiration_month` | The month when the card expires.               |
| `expiration_year`  | The year when the card expires.                |
| `cardholder_name`  | The full name of the cardholder as on the card.|

```js
const cards = await liteCheckout.saveCustomerCard({
    card_number: "4111111111111111",
    cvv: "123",
    expiration_month: "12",
    expiration_year: "25",
    cardholder_name: "John Doe",
  });
```

#### Remove Customer Card

Use the `removeCustomerCards` method to delete a previously saved customer card by passing the card ID as parameter:

```js
const cards = await liteCheckout.removeCustomerCards(cardId);
```

### Get Customer Payment Methods

```javascript
const paymentMethods = await liteCheckout.getCustomerPaymentMethods();
```

### Payment

To create a new payment with the Lite SDK, use the `payment` method. This method requires an object as parameter with the following data:

| Key              | Description                                         |

    // card: "skyflow_id" // for a selected saved card.
    // payment_method: "Spei", // For the selected payment method.
  };

  const responsePayment = await liteCheckout.payment(paymentData);
```

### 3DS Verification

You can use the `verify3dsTransaction()` method to validate if a 3DS challenge was successful or not. Use the example below to call the method and handle the response as needed:

```javascript
const verificationResult = await liteCheckout.verify3dsTransaction().then(response => {
    console.log('Verify 3ds response', response);
    
    if (response.transaction_status === 'Success') {
      alert('3DS Transaction verified.');
      // Proceed with normal payment flow
    } else if (response.transaction_status === 'Failed') {
      alert('3DS Transaction Failed');
    }
  });
```

## Field Validation

Tonder's SDK provides validation functions to ensure the integrity of card data before submitting them:

| Function                                   | Description                                           |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `validateCardNumber(cardNumber)`           | Validates the card number using the Luhn algorithm.   |
| `validateCardholderName(name)`             | Checks if the cardholder name is valid.               |
| `validateCVV(cvv)`                         | Ensures the CVV is in the correct format.             |
| `validateExpirationDate(expirationDate)`   | Validates the expiration date in MM/YY format.        |
| `validateExpirationMonth(month)`           | Checks if the expiration month is valid.              |
| `validateExpirationYear(year)`             | Validates the expiration year.                        |

```js Example
import {
  validateCardNumber,
  validateCardholderName,
  validateCVV,
  validateExpirationDate,
} from "tonder-web-sdk";

const cardNumber = "4111111111111111";
const cardholderName = "John Doe";
const cvv = "123";
const expirationDate = "12/25";

if (
  validateCardNumber(cardNumber) &&
  validateCardholderName(cardholderName) &&
  validateCVV(cvv) &&
  validateExpirationDate(expirationDate)
) {
  // Proceed with payment
} else {
  // Show error message
}
```
