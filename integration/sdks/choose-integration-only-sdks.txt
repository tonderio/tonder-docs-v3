## Making the Decision

When deciding between the Lite and Full SDKs, consider the following questions:

- **How much customization do you need?** If your project requires a highly tailored user experience, the Lite SDK is the better choice. For faster, standardized implementations, the Full SDK is more suitable.
- **What is your timeline?** If you need to deploy quickly, the Full SDK offers a faster path to implementation.
- **What resources are available?** If you have the resources for custom development and integration, the Lite SDK provides the flexibility you need. For teams with limited resources, the Full SDK simplifies the process.
- **Do you need saved card functionality?** If handling saved cards is a priority for your users, the Full SDK's built-in feature will be beneficial.

By carefully evaluating these factors, you can choose the Tonder SDK that best meets your project's requirements, ensuring a successful integration and a positive user experience.
