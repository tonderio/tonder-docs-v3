'og:description': "Integrate Tonder into your Flutter mobile application with our Lite SDK. Securely collect and tokenize sensitive data while creating personalized designs and workflows."
---

The Tonder Flutter SDK Lite is a solution for integrating our system into your mobile application. This solution ensures PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) by securely collecting and tokenizing sensitive data in the browser, without exposing your front-end infrastructure to any sensitive data.

With the Lite SDK, you can create personalized designs and workflows to register your customers' cards in the vault. This gives you with the flexibility to customize the registration process according to your business needs and preferences.

This guide will walk you through all the steps, from installation and configuring our SDK to fit your application.

## Installation

Tonder's Flutter SDK Lite can be installed using the following command, or by adding the dependency directly into your project:
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Command line">
    ```sh
    flutter pub add tonder_sdk_lite
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Add dependency">
    ```yml
    dependencies:
        tonder_sdk_lite: ^0.0.1
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Requirements

To deploy to **Android** or **MacOS** you need to add the following:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Android">
    To deploy to Android, you need to edit your `AndroidManifest.xml` file, adding the internet permission to it:

    ```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="MacOS">
    To deploy to MacOS, you need to edit your `macos/Runner/DebugProfile.entitlements` and `macos/Runner/Release.entitlements` files to include the network client entitlement to it:

    ```xml
    <key>com.apple.security.network.client</key>
    <true/>
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configuration

With Tonder's SDK installed, and requirements met, you are ready to configure and use our SDK. The following step-by-step process takes you through everything, from starting a new instance, to using the available methods:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Import the SDK into your file">
    You need to start by adding the import statement for the `liteCheckout` class in your file. Following you find an example of how to import the `liteCheckout`:
    
    ```dart
    import 'package:tonder_sdk_lite/network/liteCheckout.dart';
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize Tonder's SDK Instance">
    Initialize the Tonder's Flutter SDK instance with the following parameters:

    | Field         | Description                                                   |
    |---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
    | `baseUrlTonder`   | Tonder's API  base URL.<br></br>-> Live server: `http://stage.tonder.io`<br></br>-> Mock Server: `https://stoplight.io/mocks/tonder/tonder-api-v1-2/3152148`    |
    | `apiKeyTonder`  | Your Tonder API key. You can find it in your [Tonder dashboard](https://stage.tonder.io/dashboard/developers/). |

    ```dart
    const String baseUrlTonder = 'https://stage.tonder.io';
    const String apiKeyTonder = '00d17d61e9240c6e0611fbdb1558e636ed6389db';

    LiteCheckout sdkTonder = LiteCheckout(baseUrlTonder, apiKeyTonder);
    ```

    <Warning>
      Ensure all **API keys** and sensitive data are secured and not hardcoded in production applications. Use environment variables or a secure way to load such configurations.
    </Warning>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Use the methods available">
    After initializing the SDK, you have at your disposal a set of methods, allowing you full control over the checkout process. Refer to the [Class Methods](#class-methods) section to learn more about each one.
  </Step>
