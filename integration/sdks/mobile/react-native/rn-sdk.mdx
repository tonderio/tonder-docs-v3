{/* https://github.com/tonderio/rn-sdk */}

The Tonder React Native SDK is a solution for integrating our system into your mobile application. This solution ensures PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) by securely collecting and tokenizing sensitive data in the browser, without exposing your front-end infrastructure to any sensitive data.

This guide will walk you through all the steps, from installation and configuring our SDK to fit your application.

## Installation

Tonderâ€™s React Native SDK can be installed using our npm package. Use the following command to install it:

```bash
npm install @tonder.io/rn-sdk
```

## Requirements

Our SDK requires the following package versions to work properly:

- `react-native >= 0.70`
- `react >= 16.8`
- `react-native-svg >= 15.0.0`
- `react-native-webview >= 13.6.0`

<Warning>
  With older versions, Tonder's SDK won't work.
</Warning>

## Features

Tonder's React Native SDK offers you three integrations types with their own benefits, and each type can be specified when initializing the SDK through the `TonderProvider`, as exemplified below:

```jsx
// Full Payment UI
<TonderProvider
  config={{
    type: SDKType.INLINE,
    mode: 'development',
    apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  }}
>
  <YourApp />
</TonderProvider>

// Custom UI with Individual Components
<TonderProvider
  config={{
    type: SDKType.LITE,
    mode: 'development',
    apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  }}
>
  <YourApp />
</TonderProvider>

// Card Enrollment
<TonderProvider
  config={{
    type: SDKType.ENROLLMENT,
    mode: 'development',
    apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  }}
>
  <YourApp />
</TonderProvider>
```

Refer to each type's page to learn about their features, and how to integrate each:
