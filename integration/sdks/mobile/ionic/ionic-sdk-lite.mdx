'og:description': "Integrate Tonder into your Ionic mobile application with our Lite SDK. Securely collect and tokenize sensitive data while creating personalized designs and workflows."
---

The Tonder Ionic SDK Lite is a solution for integrating our system into your mobile application. This solution ensures PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) by securely collecting and tokenizing sensitive data in the browser, without exposing your front-end infrastructure to any sensitive data.

This guide will walk you through all the steps, from installation and configuring our SDK to fit your application.

## Installation

Tonder's Ionic SDK can be installed using our [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tonder.io/ionic-lite-sdk). Use the following command to install it:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
    ```bash
    npm i @tonder.io/ionic-lite-sdk
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add @tonder.io/ionic-lite-sdk
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add @tonder.io/ionic-lite-sdk
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>



## Requirements

To configure our SDK you need to add the following script tags to your HTML:

```html
  <script src=https://openpay.s3.amazonaws.com/openpay.v1.min.js></script>
  <script src=https://openpay.s3.amazonaws.com/openpay-data.v1.min.js></script>
```

The code above is necessary to ensure a reliable connection to the payment processor.

<Note>You can also install each one with their respective [npm packages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openpay-js).</Note>

## Configuration

With Tonder's SDK installed, and requirements met, you are ready to configure and use the SDK. The following step-by-step process takes you through everything, from starting a new instance, to performing a new transaction using the needed methods:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Import the Lite Checkout class">
    Start by adding the import statement for the `LiteCheckout` class in your file. Following you find an example of how to import the `LiteCheckout`:

    ```js
      import { LiteCheckout } from "@tonder/ionic-lite-sdk"
    ```

    <Tip>
      The `LiteCheckout` object provides all the necessary methods to perform transactions. Essentially, LiteCheckout handles calls to Tonder services, allowing transactions to be performed without the need to integrate additional visual components.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize Tonder's SDK Instance">
    Initialize Tonder's Ionic SDK instance adding the following parameters:

| Field         | Description                                                   |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `signal`      | Signal from AbortController instance if it needs cancel the request.        |
| `baseUrlTonder`   | Tonder's API  base URL.<br></br>-> Live server: `https://stage.tonder.io`<br></br>-> Mock Server: `https://stoplight.io/mocks/tonder/tonder-api-v1-2/3152148`    |
| `apiKeyTonder`  | Your Tonder API key. You can find it in your [Tonder dashboard](https://stage.tonder.io/dashboard/developers/). |

    ```js
      const baseUrlTonder = 'https://stage.tonder.io';
      const apiKeyTonder = '00d17d61e9240c6e0611fbdb1558e636ed6389db';

      const liteCheckout = new LiteCheckout({ 
        signal, 
        baseUrlTonder, 
        apiKeyTonder 
      });
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Checkout Router Full method">
    Once you have initialized your `liteCheckout` instance, you need to call the `startCheckoutRouterFull` method and provide all the necessary data as an object. This method handles the entire checkout process, executing the transaction and returning the payment response. To start, call the `startCheckoutRouterFullmethod` providing the necessary information found below:

    | Parameter     | Type          | Description                                                   |
    |---------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
    | `order`       | `object`        | Represents the details of each item in the order.             |
    | `total`       | `number`        | The total amount for the order. This should match the sum of the costs of items in the order. |
    | `customer`    | `object`        | Information about the customer.                               |
    | `skyflowTokens` | `object`       | The details of the card to be used on the transaction.        |
    | `return_url`  | `string`        | URL to which the customer will be redirected after the checkout process is completed. |
    | `isSandbox`   | `boolean`       | A boolean indicating if the transaction is being processed in a sandbox environment for testing purposes. |
    | `metadata`    | `object`        | Optional additional data about the order that might be used for processing or tracking. |
    | `currency`    | `string`        | The currency in which the transaction is conducted. Refer to the [Currencies Reference](/reference/currencies) page for details.           |

    ```js
      const checkoutResponse = liteCheckout.startCheckoutRouterFull({ 
        order, 
        total, 
        customer, 
        skyflowTokens, 
        return_url, 
        isSandbox, 
        metadata, 
        currency
      });
    ```

    Below you find the types for each `startCheckoutRouterFull` parameter, followed by an example code:

    ```ts
      type StartCheckoutFullRequest = {
          order: {
              items: Array<{
                  description: string;

                  name: string;
                  amount_total: number;
              }>;
          };
          total: number;
          customer: {

              lastname: string;
              email: string;
              phone: string;
          };

      business: {
          pk: number,
          name: string,
          categories: [
            {

### Tokenization

To retrieve the tokenized values you need to call the `getSkyflowTokens` method. 
    
This method requires an object as parameter with `vault_id` and `vault_url` recovered with the `getBusiness` method, and a `data` object with the following information:

| Field              | Description                              |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| card_number        | Card number entered in the payment form.   |
| cvv                | CVV (Card Verification Value) from the payment form. |
| expiration_month   | Expiration month of the card from the payment form. |
| expiration_year    | Expiration year of the card from the payment form. |
| cardholder_name    | Cardholder's name from the payment form.   |

<Tip>These values above come from your html form.</Tip>

With the required parameter in hand, call the method as presented below:

```js
  const skyflowFields = {
    card_number: this.paymentForm.value.cardNumber,
    cvv: this.paymentForm.value.cvv,
    expiration_month: this.paymentForm.value.month,
    expiration_year: this.paymentForm.value.expirationYear,
    cardholder_name: this.paymentForm.value.name
  }

  const { vault_id, vault_url } = merchantData;


  const skyflowTokens = await liteCheckout.getSkyflowTokens({
    vault_id: vault_id,
    vault_url: vault_url,
    data: skyflowFields
  })
```

<Accordion title="Get tokenization response">
  The response to this method will be the following:

  ```ts
    {
      vaultID: string,

### 3DS Verification

You can use the `verify3dsTransaction()` method to validate if a 3DS challenge was successful or not. Use the example below to call the method and handle the response as needed:

```js
  inlineCheckout.verify3dsTransaction().then(response => {
    console.log('Verify 3ds response', response);
    
    if (response.status === 'Success') {
      alert('3DS Transaction verified.');
      // Proceed with normal payment flow
    } else if (response.status === 'Failed') {
      alert('3DS Transaction Failed');
    }
  });
```
