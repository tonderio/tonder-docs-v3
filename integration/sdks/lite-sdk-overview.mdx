## What is Lite SDK?

Lite SDK lets you **build completely custom payment interfaces** while Tonder handles the secure tokenization of sensitive data. You have full control over the user experience and design, while we manage PCI compliance and payment processing.

## Key Features

Here's a quick overview of what Lite SDK offers and how it compares to other integration models:

| Aspect             | Details                                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Money Flows**    | ✅ Deposits<br/>❌ Withdrawals (use Standalone Withdrawals API) |
| **Setup**          | Install SDK, build custom forms, integrate tokenization      |
| **Customization**  | Complete UX/UI control                                       |
| **UI Location**    | Your custom forms and customer journey                       |
| **PCI Compliance** | Tonder tokenizes data                                        |
| **Code Required**  | Build payment forms                                          |
| **Setup Time**     | 5-7 days (est.)                                              |
| **Platforms**      | Web (JavaScript), iOS, Android, React Native, Ionic, Flutter |
| **Best For**       | Custom brand experiences, unique UI requirements             |

Choose Lite SDK when:

- Brand consistency is critical
- You have specific UX requirements (e.g. custom check-out)
- You have a strong frontend team

<Warning>
**Longer implementation time and development required**

When using Lite SDK, you'll need to build your own payment forms and UI, which requires more development effort and time compared to using pre-built components.
</Warning>
