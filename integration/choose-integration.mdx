"og:description": "Discover the various integration models Tonder offers for accepting deposits and sending withdrawals. This guide will help you select the best integration approach based on your technical capabilities, time to market, customization needs, and compliance requirements."
---

Tonder offers multiple integration models to accept deposits and send withdrawals. Selecting the right model is critical for your project's success, as it impacts your time to market, development resources, user experience, and compliance requirements.

This guide will help you understand:

- The four primary integration models for accepting payments.
- The standalone Withdrawals API for sending payouts.
- The key differences to help you select the right model for your needs.
- Real-world use cases for platforms like gaming and e-commerce.

## Before You Choose

Consider these key questions to guide your decision:

- Do you have developers available to write code?
- How quickly do you need to launch and start accepting payments?
- Is a custom-branded user interface essential for your checkout flow?
- Does your organization hold a valid PCI DSS certification?
- Do you need to both accept payments (deposits) and send payouts (withdrawals)?

After answering these questions, review the integration models below to find the best fit for your business.

## Integration Models in Detail

Dive into the specifics of each model to understand its architecture, features, and limitations.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Hosted Checkout">
  A ready-to-use, Tonder-hosted payment page accessed via a redirect URL. This is the fastest way to start accepting payments.
  | Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **UI Location** | Tonder-hosted pages |
| **Money Flows** | ✅ Deposits <br/> ✅ Refunds (via Dashboard) <br/> ❌ Withdrawals |
| **Setup** | Create payment links via the dashboard or an API call. |
| **Code Required** | No |
| **Customization** | Upload your logo and set brand colors. |
| **PCI Compliance** | Tonder manages all PCI compliance. |

<Note>
  **Use this model if** 
  
  You need to launch immediately and accept payments
  quickly. You do not have a technical team or development resources. Your
  payment needs are straightforward.
</Note>

<Note>
  **Limitations** 
  
  Cannot be embedded directly into your application or website.
  Customization options are limited to branding basics.
</Note>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Full SDK (Pre-built UI)">
    A pre-built checkout interface that you can embed directly into your application, providing a more integrated user experience than a redirect.

| Aspect             | Details                                                        |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **UI Location**    | Embedded in your application (e.g., via iframe).               |
| **Money Flows**    | ✅ Deposits <br/> ❌ Withdrawals                               |
| **Setup**          | Install the SDK, configure your keys, and embed the component. |
| **Code Required**  | Low integration code.                                          |
| **Customization**  | Styling options (colors, fonts, spacing).                      |
| **PCI Compliance** | Tonder handles sensitive data via tokenization.                |
| **Platforms**      | Web (JavaScript), iOS, Android, React Native, Ionic, Flutter.  |

<Note>
  **Use this model if** 
  
  You need an embedded checkout experience within your
  website or mobile app. A standard but styleable UI is acceptable for your
  brand. You are building a mobile application and want a native-feel checkout
</Note>

<Note>
  **Limitations** 
  
  UI customization is limited to styling; the layout and flow
  are fixed.

> **PCI Certification is Required**
>
> With this model, your servers will handle raw card data, making PCI DSS certification mandatory. You must provide a valid Attestation of Compliance (AOC) before starting your implementation.

<Note>
  **Use this model if**: 
  
  Your organization is already PCI certified. You need to
  support deposits, withdrawals, and refunds within a single integration. You
  process a high volume of transactions and require maximum control and
  flexibility.
</Note>

<Note>
  **Limitations** 
  
  PCI certification is a strict prerequisite. The longest and
  most complex implementation path.

## Withdrawals API

The Withdrawals API is a standalone, server-to-server API designed exclusively for sending payments to recipients.

| Aspect            | Details                                                                             |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Money Flow**    | ✅ Withdrawals only                                                                 |
| **Combines With** | Can be used alongside _any_ deposit integration model (Hosted, Full SDK, Lite SDK). |
| **PCI Scope**     | Tonder manages PCI compliance for this API.                                         |
| **Setup Time**    | 1-2 days (est.)                                                                     |
| **Use Cases**     | Player payouts, seller payments, affiliate commissions, etc.                        |

<Note>
  **Key Point** The Withdrawals API is independent of deposit integrations. You
  can add withdrawal functionality without modifying your existing payment
  acceptance setup.

## Use Cases

Every single integration model can be used to support various use cases. Here are some common scenarios and the recommended models for each:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Receiving Deposits">
   The Gaming Platform must securely accept deposits from players to initiate the user experience. Developers can choose from multiple endorsed models to meet this need:
   
   - Hosted Checkout: The fastest option, requiring no code and minimal setup (estimated $\mathbf{1}$ day).
   - Full SDK/Lite SDK: These models allow for an embedded checkout experience. Full SDK is quicker (2-3 days) with a standard UI, while the Lite SDK provides complete customization.
   - API Integration: The model that offers maximum control, but the merchant must be PCI certified (L1 ROC or L2 SAQ D required).
   
   All these models support Deposits and Refunds

</Tab>
  <Tab title="Sending Payouts">
    To satisfy the need to send winnings to players, the Gaming Platform must implement robust withdrawal capabilities. The two primary endorsed models for this outflow are:
    
    - Withdrawals API: This standalone, independent API is for Withdrawals only and can be combined with any deposit model. Implementation is a server-to-server API with an estimated setup of 1-2 days.
    - API Integration (Direct Connect): This single integration handles all three money flows (Deposits, Withdrawals, Refunds), but is only suitable if the platform is PCI certified.
    
    This flexible approach simplifies integration, compliance and transaction monitoring.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Accepting Payments">

For the E-commerce web site, the core need is to securely accept customer payments. Developers can choose from endorsed models that balance speed, customization, and compliance:

- Hosted Checkout: Best for the fastest implementation (1 day) and sites with no code required.
- Full SDK/Lite SDK: Offer embedded checkout with the Full SDK providing a standard UI and the Lite SDK offering complete UX/UI control for strong branding.
- Direct Connect API Integration (S2S): Allows for maximum control and full backend integration, but requires the merchant to be PCI certified.

These models all support Deposits and Refunds , providing a complete, scalable, transaction system optimized for e-commerce.
