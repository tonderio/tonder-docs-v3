### API Integration

- **Requirements**: API integration requires the merchant company to be PCI-certified. The merchant also needs to forward their Attestation of Compliance (AOC) certification to Tonder before beginning the implementation.
- **Customization**: The merchant can completely customize the front and back end since the integration is a back-to-back implementation.
- **Flexibility**: Provides high flexibility in terms of design and functionality, allowing developers to create a tailored experience.
- **Target Audience**: Best suited for merchants that are PCI-certified and need a highly customized solution.

### E-commerce Plugins

- **Ease of Implementation**: Tonder's plugins are designed to integrate easily into major e-commerce platforms with minimal configuration, without writing any code.
- **User Experience**: Improves the checkout process and helps businesses accept more payment methods.
- **PCI Compliance**: Plugins are PCI-compliant, ensuring secure transactions.

## Making the Decision

When deciding between the Tonder integration options, consider the following questions:


<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How much customization do you need?">
    For a highly tailored user experience, consider the Lite SDK or API integration. For faster, standardized implementations, the Full SDK or e-commerce plugins are more suitable.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is your timeline?">
    If you need to deploy quickly, the Full SDK or e-commerce plugins offer a faster path to implementation.
  </Accordion> 

  <Accordion title="What resources are available?">
    If you have the resources for custom development and integration, the Lite SDK or API integration provides the flexibility you need. For teams with limited resources, the Full SDK or e-commerce plugins simplify the process.
  </Accordion> 

  <Accordion title="What are your security requirements?">
    If you are using API integration, ensure you have the necessary PCI certification and AOC. The other options include PCI compliance as part of the package.
  </Accordion> 
</AccordionGroup>

By carefully evaluating these factors, you can choose the Tonder integration that best meets your project's requirements, ensuring a successful implementation and a positive user experience.
