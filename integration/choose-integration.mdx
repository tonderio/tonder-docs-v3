# Choosing Your Tonder Integration Model

Tonder offers multiple integration models to accept deposits and send withdrawals. Selecting the right model is critical for your project's success, as it impacts your time to market, development resources, user experience, and compliance requirements.

This guide will help you understand:

- The four primary integration models for accepting payments.
- The standalone Withdrawals API for sending payouts.
- The key differences to help you select the right model for your needs.
- Real-world use cases for platforms like gaming and e-commerce.

### Before You Choose

Consider these key questions to guide your decision:

- Do you have developers available to write code?
- How quickly do you need to launch and start accepting payments?
- Is a custom-branded user interface essential for your checkout flow?
- Does your organization hold a valid PCI DSS certification?
- Do you need to both accept payments (deposits) and send payouts (withdrawals)?

## Integration Models in Detail

Dive into the specifics of each model to understand its architecture, features, and limitations.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Hosted Checkout">
  A ready-to-use, Tonder-hosted payment page accessed via a redirect URL. This is the fastest way to start accepting payments.
  | Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **UI Location** | Tonder-hosted pages |
| **Money Flows** | ✅ Deposits <br/> ✅ Refunds (via Dashboard) <br/> ❌ Withdrawals |
| **Setup** | Create payment links via the dashboard or an API call. |
| **Code Required** | No |
| **Customization** | Upload your logo and set brand colors. |
| **PCI Compliance** | Tonder manages all PCI compliance. |

<Note>
  **When to Choose Hosted Checkout**: You need to launch immediately and accept
  payments quickly. You do not have a technical team or development resources.
  Your payment needs are straightforward.
</Note>

<Note>
  **Limitations**: Cannot be embedded directly into your application or website.
  Customization options are limited to branding basics.
</Note>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Full SDK (Pre-built UI)">
    A pre-built checkout interface that you can embed directly into your application, providing a more integrated user experience than a redirect.

| Aspect             | Details                                                        |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **UI Location**    | Embedded in your application (e.g., via iframe).               |
| **Money Flows**    | ✅ Deposits <br/> ❌ Withdrawals                               |
| **Setup**          | Install the SDK, configure your keys, and embed the component. |
| **Code Required**  | Low integration code.                                          |
| **Customization**  | Styling options (colors, fonts, spacing).                      |
| **PCI Compliance** | Tonder handles sensitive data via tokenization.                |
| **Platforms**      | Web (JavaScript), iOS, Android, React Native, Ionic, Flutter.  |

{" "}
<Note>
  **When to Choose the Full SDK**: You need an embedded checkout experience
  within your website or mobile app. A standard but styleable UI is acceptable
  for your brand. You are building a mobile application and want a native-feel
  checkout
</Note>

<Note>
  **Limitations**: UI customization is limited to styling; the layout and flow
  are fixed.

    Direct backend API integration gives you complete control over the payment flow, data handling, and user interface.

| **Money Flows**    | ✅ Deposits <br/> ✅ Withdrawals <br/> ✅ Refunds              |
| **Setup**          | Full back-end API integration.                                 |
| **Code Required**  | Full-stack development effort.                                 |
| **Customization**  | Complete control over all aspects of the payment process.      |
| **PCI Compliance** | **You must be PCI certified**.                                 |

> **PCI Certification is Required**
>
> With this model, your servers will handle raw card data, making PCI DSS certification mandatory. You must provide a valid Attestation of Compliance (AOC) before starting your implementation.

<Note>
  **When to Choose API Direct Integration**: Your organization is already PCI
  certified. You need to support deposits, withdrawals, and refunds within a
  single integration. You process a high volume of transactions and require
  maximum control and flexibility.
</Note>

<Note>
  **Limitations**: PCI certification is a strict prerequisite. The longest and
  most complex implementation path.

| **PCI Scope**     | Tonder manages PCI compliance for this API.                                         |
| **Setup Time**    | 1-2 days (est.)                                                                     |

  can add withdrawal functionality without modifying your existing payment
  acceptance setup.
