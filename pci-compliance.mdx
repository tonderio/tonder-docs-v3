## Security First

Security is priority at Tonder, which is why we are committed to complying with the highest standards in the industry, 'PCI Compliance'.

## What is PCI (Payment Card Industry) Compliance ?

PCI is a set of rules that must be followed by merchants who store, process, or transmit credit cardholder data. This is in order to reduce payment card fraud by establishing fundamental security in the payment ecosystem. Governments do not monitor PCI compliance, but card brands can penalize non-compliant merchants.

## Is it an obligation? 

Any business that processes, transmits or stores credit card data, regardless of the size or number of transactions made, must be PCI compliant. Therefore, if your business accepts cards as a method of payment, you must follow the PCI rules.
