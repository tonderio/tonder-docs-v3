Every transaction in Tonder begins as a payment. Any successful payment can be refunded or be part of a dispute, depending on your client's request. Each mentioned process, payment, refund, or dispute can have a different status, representing the current processing stage. This page presents an overview of these transaction types, outlining processes and possible statuses they can assume.

## Payments

A payment transfers funds from the payer to the payee for goods or services rendered. The lifecycle of a Payment in Tonder is presented in the workflow below. When you create a payment, it'll always have the **Pending** status.

|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pending**   | A payment attempt is processing. Occurs mostly with asynchronous payment processors. It's the default status after the payment creation.                        |
| **Authorized**| The payment processor has authorized the payment attempt.                                                    |

| **Cancelled** | Payment was canceled before settlement, often initiated by the customer prior to completion. |


## Refunds

A refund is a merchant-initiated process of reimbursing a customer due to reasons such as returns, cancellations, or dissatisfaction with goods or services. The merchant uses the Tonder dashboard to initiate the refund. The workflow below outlines the lifecycle of a refund within Tonder. When you create a refund, it'll always have the **Pending** status.

## Disputes

A dispute is a formal complaint filed by a customer through our platform, contesting the validity of a transaction. The customer can initiate a dispute for various reasons, such as unauthorized charges, non-receipt of goods, dissatisfaction with the transaction outcome, or any other issues. Below, you will find a workflow presenting the lifecycle of a dispute in Tonder. When a dispute is created, it'll have the **Needs response** status.
