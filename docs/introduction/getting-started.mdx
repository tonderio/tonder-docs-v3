Tonder's payment infrastructure is designed specifically for digital commerce companies. This guide provides developers and businesses with a clear, step-by-step approach to creating their first payment and seamlessly integrating our solution into their platform.

## Step 1: Set up your account

This step will walk you through the initial setup of connections.

<Note>
 The Tonder team will create a Sandbox account for you, where you can set up your organizational details and change your password.
</Note>

### Adding your first connections

To integrate Tonder with payment providers, do the following:

1. Navigate to the [Connections](../dashboard/connections) section of the dashboard.
2. Select the payment provider you want to connect.
3. Enter the respective payment provider Sandbox(test) API Keys.
4. Click the **Connect** button.

<Check>
 You can check if the connection is successful by going to the [**Your Connections**](../dashboard/connections#your-connections) section.
</Check>

## Step 2: Process your first payment

To simulate a payment, we will guide you through creating a payment link and making the payment with a test card, to validate the connection and check the response from the provider inside the [Transactions](../dashboard/transactions) section of the dashboard.

### Create a Payment link

To create a payment link, perform the following steps:

1. Access the [Payment Links](../dashboard/payment-links) section of the dashboard.
2. Click the **+Create** button on the top-right corner.
3. Fill in the required fields. As this is a simulation, any data will suffice.
4. Click the **Create new Link** button at the top of the screen.

### Executing the test payment

To execute the payment, you need to:

1. Access the payment link.
2. Select **Pay with Credit/debit card**.
3. Use one of the following cards:

|                      Provider                           |             Card Number            |          Cardholder          |                 CVC                |                Date               |

|                     **Openpay**                         |         2223000048400011           |           Any name           |          Any three digits          |          Any future date          |


## Step 3: Validate the payment

After executing the payment with one of the available test cards, you need to check if the payment was successful. You can do it by going to the [Transaction](../dashboard/transactions) section and clicking on the transaction to view the response from the payment provider.
