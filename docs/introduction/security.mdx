Tokenization is a process of replacing sensitive payment information with a temporary, one-time token. When you use Tonder for tokenization, we will handle the responsibility for PCI compliance. This will enable you to create and manage payment instruments by tokenizing user payment information in our secure vault. Each instrument will be associated with a unique ID, ensuring that the payment information remains safe and secure.

Tonder’s PCI Vault secures your customers’ payment data through tokenization, offering advantages such as:

- **Streamlined checkouts**: Tonder's PCI Vault replaces sensitive payment info with secure tokens, streamlining transactions by eliminating the need for customers to repeatedly enter payment details.
- **User-controlled card management**: With Tonder's PCI Vault, customers can manage and secure their stored payment cards with tokenization. This provides flexibility to add, update, or remove payment instruments associated with their accounts.

## Safeguarding Cardholder Information

Tonder ensures that your card data is highly secure during the checkout process by maintaining the highest security standards.

- **Isolated Network:** Card data is stored on a separate network and decryption keys are kept on distinct machines, ensuring complete separation. The cards are inaccessible as plain text to any system.
- **Network tokenization:**  Tokenization is a security method that replaces sensitive payment card information with unique tokens during transmission over a network. This technique enhances data protection and reduces the risk of fraud.
