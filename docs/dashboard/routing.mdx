Routing is a useful tool that enables businesses to send payments to the correct destination in an intelligent manner. It does so by utilizing various rules and considering factors such as fees, location, transaction value, and potential risks to ensure that payments are sent to their intended processor.

## Benefits

Taking advantage of Tonder's routing feature gives your business many benefits, like:

  <Card title="Diversified Providers">
    Spreading transaction processing across multiple payment providers is a great way to reduce reliance on a single provider. This ensures that payment processing continues even in the face of network or technical issues with the primary provider. By doing so, businesses can maintain their operations and minimize potential revenue loss.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fraud Mitigation and Flexibility">
    By offering flexibility on the payment page, it helps to minimize the risk of chargeback fraud. Merchants can decide when to apply extra security measures like 3D Secure or anti-fraud mechanisms based on the level of risk associated with the transaction and the behavior of the customer. This not only enhances security but also minimizes losses related to fraud.

  <Card title="Lower Costs">
    Helps to decrease transaction costs by determining the most efficient processing route.

  <Card title="Retry Failed Payments">
    This can increase the chances of successful transactions and improve customer experience by retrying failed payments through an alternative provider.

## Dynamic routing

Dynamic routing is a smart approach that efficiently routes payment transactions to the most suitable payment service provider or acquiring bank. This selection process takes into consideration various factors, including the type of card BIN, the transaction amount, currency, origin of the payment, additional fields like order ID, and more.
