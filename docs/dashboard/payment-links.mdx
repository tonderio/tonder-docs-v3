Payment Links represent a versatile payment tool. These are unique URLs or hyperlinks generated by Tonder, designed to simplify and streamline the payment process for businesses and their customers.

The Payment Links section of Tonder's dashboard gives you an overview of all your generated payment links, and details about each are presented as a table. These details are as follows:

| Field    | Description                                                                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product  | The name or identifier of the payment link.                                           |
| Amount   | The monetary value or price set for the payment link.                                 |
| Link URL | The unique URL provided to users to access and make payments.                         |
| Status   | The current status of the payment link (e.g., Active, Inactive).                      |
| Created  | The date or timestamp when the payment link was created.                              |
| Arrow (>)| Access to each [payment link's details](#payment-link-details) page on the dashboard. |

In this section, Tonder allows you to easily create payment links, access each link details page, and customize the payment links' checkout page to match your brand's style.
