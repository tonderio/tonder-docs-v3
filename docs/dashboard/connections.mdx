## Connecting a provider

Providers require you to add specific API credentials, and the fields you need to fill for each will vary depending on the needs of each provider. At Tonder's dashboard, when you select a new provider and start the connection process, you will be shown the required fields so that you can proceed with ease.

### Other funcionalities

Tonder presents additional options when connecting a new provider. Depending on availability, you can toggle the following:

## Your Connections

In the Connections section, you can find a tab named **Your Connections** that presents all your connected processors and allows you to set the default/static transaction route with Tonder. 

This Static Routing operates in a cascade or waterfall fashion by predefining fixed paths for data packets to follow. In case of a soft decline, the system will route the transaction to the next provider in the processing sequence. However, if the transaction results in a hard decline, no further routing of transactions will take place. 

Tonder allows you to:

- Toggle on/off any connected processor.
- Change the order of connected processors by dragging and dropping each on the needed position.

<Tip>
  The first processor on the list (numbered 1) will be the primary processor to receive the transaction attempts.
