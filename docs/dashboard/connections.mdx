## Benefits of connecting your payment providers with Tonder

- **Centralized Management**: Tonder serves as a central hub to connect and manage multiple payment providers. By consolidating all payment-related activities into a single platform, it streamlines payment operations. The dashboard allows businesses to easily integrate various payment methods and providers, offering customers more choices for making payments. This can lead to increased sales and improved customer satisfaction.

- **Efficiency and Automation**: Automate payment processes such as routing, reconciliation, and reporting. This reduces manual work, minimizes errors, and boosts operational efficiency.

## Connecting a provider

Providers require you to add specific API credentials, and the fields you need to fill for each will vary depending on the needs of each provider. At Tonder's dashboard, when you select a new provider and start the connection process, you will be shown the required fields so that you can proceed with ease.

### Other funcionalities

Tonder presents additional options when connecting a new provider. Depending on availability, you can toggle the following:

- **3D Secure 2.0**: Integrate the advanced security features of 3D Secure 2.0 into the payment providers you have chosen.
- **Installments**: Add Installments (MSI) to your payments.

## Your Connections

In the Connections section, you can find a tab named **Your Connections** that lets you see all your connected processors and set the default transaction route with Tonder. The default transaction route is the primary path that all transactions with Tonder will take. Here you can:

- Toggle on/off any connected processor.
- Change the order of connected processors by dragging and dropping each to your desired route.

<Tip>
  The first processor on the list (numbered 1) will be the primary processor to receive the transaction attempts.
