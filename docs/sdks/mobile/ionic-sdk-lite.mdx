The Tonder Ionic SDK Lite is a solution for integrating our system into your mobile application. This solution ensures PCI compliance by securely collecting and tokenizing sensitive data in the browser, without exposing your front-end infrastructure to any sensitive data.

This guide will walk you through all the steps, from installation and configuring our SDK to fit your appliocation.

## Installation

Tonder's Ionic SDK can be installed using our npm package. To do so, use the following command:

```curl
  npm i @tonder/ionic-lite-sdk
```

## Requirements

To configure our SDK you need to add the following script tags to your HTML:

```html
  <script src=https://openpay.s3.amazonaws.com/openpay.v1.min.js></script>
  <script src=https://openpay.s3.amazonaws.com/openpay-data.v1.min.js></script>
```

These tags are needed to integrate with OpenPay to use them as a payment processor.

<Note>You can also install each one with their respectives npm packages</Note>

## Configuration

To properly initialize an instance of Tonder's Ionic SDK, ensure that you have configured it properly. Follow the usage example below:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Import the Lite Checkout class">
    You need to start by adding the import  statement for the `LiteCheckout` class in your file. This is how you it:

    ```js
      import { LiteCheckout } from "@tonder/ionic-lite-sdk"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize Tonder's SDK Instance">
    Initialize the Tonder's Ionic SDK instance with the following parameters:

| Field         | Description                                                   |

```js
const merchantData = await liteCheckout.getBusiness();
```

<Accordion title="Get Business response">
  The response to this method will be the following:

  ```ts
    {
      business: {
          pk: number,
          name: string,
          categories: [
            {
              pk: number,
              name: string
            }
