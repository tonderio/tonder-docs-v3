title: "Ionic SDK Lite"
---

The Tonder Ionic SDK Lite is a solution for integrating our system into your mobile application. This solution ensures PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) by securely collecting and tokenizing sensitive data in the browser, without exposing your front-end infrastructure to any sensitive data.

This guide will walk you through all the steps, from installation and configuring our SDK to fit your application.

## Installation

Tonder's Ionic SDK can be installed using our npm package. To do so, use the following command:

```curl
  npm i @tonder/ionic-lite-sdk
```

## Requirements

To configure our SDK you need to add the following script tags to your HTML:

```html
  <script src=https://openpay.s3.amazonaws.com/openpay.v1.min.js></script>
  <script src=https://openpay.s3.amazonaws.com/openpay-data.v1.min.js></script>
```

The code above is necessary to ensure a reliable connection to the payment processor.

<Note>You can also install each one with their respective npm packages</Note>

## Configuration

To initialize an instance of Tonder's Ionic SDK, ensure you have met the [installation](#installation) and [requirements](#requirements) steps. Follow the usage example below:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Import the Lite Checkout class">
    Start by adding the import statement for the `LiteCheckout` class in your file. Following you find an example of how to import the `LiteCheckout`:

    ```js
      import { LiteCheckout } from "@tonder/ionic-lite-sdk"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize Tonder's SDK Instance">
    Initialize Tonder's Ionic SDK instance adding the following parameters:

| Field         | Description                                                   |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `signal`      | Signal from AbortController instance if it needs cancel the request.        |
| `baseUrlTonder`   | Tonder's API  base URL.<br></br>-> Live server: `http://stage.tonder.io`<br></br>-> Mock Server: `https://stoplight.io/mocks/tonder/tonder-api-v1-2/3152148`    |
| `apiKeyTonder`  | Your Tonder API key. You can find it in your [Tonder dashboard](https://stage.tonder.io/dashboard/developers/). |

    ```js
      const liteCheckout = new LiteCheckout({ 
        signal, 
        baseUrlTonder, 
        apiKeyTonder 
      });
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Checkout Router Full method">
    Once you have initialized your `liteCheckout` instance, you need to call the `startCheckoutRouterFull` method and provide all the necessary data as an object. This method handles the entire checkout process, executing the transaction and returning the payment response. To start, call the `startCheckoutRouterFullmethod` providing the necessary information found below:

    | Parameter     | Type          | Description                                                   |
    |---------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
    | `order`       | `object`        | Represents the details of each item in the order.             |
    | `total`       | `number`        | The total amount for the order. This should match the sum of the costs of items in the order. |
    | `customer`    | `object`        | Information about the customer.                               |
    | `skyflowTokens` | `object`       | The details of the card to be used on the transaction.        |
    | `return_url`  | `string`        | URL to which the customer will be redirected after the checkout process is completed. |
    | `isSandbox`   | `boolean`       | A boolean indicating if the transaction is being processed in a sandbox environment for testing purposes. |
    | `metadata`    | `object`        | Optional additional data about the order that might be used for processing or tracking. |
    | `currency`    | `string`        | The currency in which the transaction is conducted (USD or MXN).           |

    ```js
      const checkoutResponse = liteCheckout.startCheckoutRouterFull({ 
        order, 
        total, 
        customer, 
        skyflowTokens, 
        return_url, 
        isSandbox, 
        metadata, 
        currency
      });
    ```

    Below you find the types for each `startCheckoutRouterFull` parameter, followed by an example code:

    ```ts
      type StartCheckoutFullRequest = {
          order: {
              items: Array<{
                  description: string;
                  quantity: number;

                  discount: number;
                  taxes: number;
                  product_reference: number;
                  name: string;
                  amount_total: number;
              }>;
          };
          total: number;
          customer: {
              name: string;
              lastname: string;
              email: string;
              phone: string;
          };
          skyflowTokens: {
              cardholder_name: string;
              card_number: string;
              cvv: string;

              expiration_month: string;
              skyflow_id: string;
          };
          return_url: string;
          isSandbox: boolean;
          metadata: any;
          currency: string;
      };
    ```
