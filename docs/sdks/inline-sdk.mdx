Tonder Inline SDK is a vanilla Javascript solution for integrating our system into your platform. To achieve PCI compliance, we also integrate with [Skyflow](https://www.skyflow.com/) to collect, tokenize, and reveal sensitive data in the browser securely without exposing your front-end infrastructure to sensitive data.

This guide will walk you through all the steps, from installation and configuring to styling the SDK to fit your website.

## Installation

Tonder gives you two ways to install our SDK. You can install our npm package or use script tags directly in your HTML.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="NPM Package">
    To install [Tonder's SDK with npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tonder-sdk-test?activeTab=readme), use the following command:

    ```curl
    npm i tonder-sdk-test
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Script tag">
    To use Tonder's SDK through script tag, add the following to your HTML:

    ```html
    <script src="https://zplit-stage.s3.amazonaws.com/v1/bundle.min.js"></script>
    ```
  </Accordion> 
</AccordionGroup>

## Requirements

To configure our SDK is add the following script tags to your HTML:

```html
<script src="https://js.skyflow.com/v1/index.js"></script>
<script src="https://openpay.s3.amazonaws.com/openpay.v1.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://openpay.s3.amazonaws.com/openpay-data.v1.min.js"></script>
```

The first tag is mandatory for achieving PCI compliance, as stated at the top of this page, by using Skyflows's integration. The other tags are needed to integrate with OpenPay to use them as a payment processor.

<Note>You can also install each one with their respectives npm packages</Note>

## Configuration

Before initializing an instance of Tonder SDK, ensure that you have configured it properly. Follow the usage example below:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the required ID to your HTML">
    Tonder's SDK needs an entry point to operate. This entry point is defined by adding a `tonder-checkout` ID to an empty `div`, like the example below:

    ```html
    <div>
        <h1>Checkout</h1>
        <!-- You have to add an entry point with the ID 'tonder-checkout' -->
        <div id="tonder-checkout">
        </div>
    </div>
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize Tonder's SDK Instance">
    Initialize the Tonder's SDK instance with the following parameters:

| Field         | Description                                                   |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `apiKey`      | The API key used for authentication and authorization.        |
| `returnUrl`   | The URL to which the user is redirected after the checkout process, regardless of success or failure. |
| `successUrl`  | The URL to which the user is redirected after a successful checkout. |
| `styles`      | Custom styles object that allows you to customize the appearance of the inline checkout. It may include properties such as colors, fonts, and other styling options. |

    <CodeGroup>

    ```javascript npm package option
    import { InlineCheckout } from "tonder-sdk-test";

    const inlineCheckout = new InlineCheckout({
      apiKey,
      returnUrl,
      successUrl,
      styles: customStyles
    });
    ```
    ```javascript Script tag option
    const inlineCheckout = new TonderSdk.InlineCheckout({
      apiKey,
      returnUrl,
      successUrl,
      styles: customStyles
    });
    ```

    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Inject checkout method">
    Call the `injectCheckout` method with your inlineCheckout instance, with the code below:

    ```javascript
    inlineCheckout.injectCheckout();
    ```

    This method will use the element with id `tonder-checkout` added in Step 1 to render the checkout elements, as exemplified by the image below:


    With this, you can render the checkout to your customers.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a pay button">
    Lastly, you need to create a button to submit the form. This button needs to have an event listener that calls the `payment` method from the `inlineCheckout` instance, sending the checkout data as payload, like presented below:

    ```javascript
    document.getElementById('your_pay_button').addEventListener('click', async () => {
      response = await inlineCheckout.payment(checkoutData);
    });
    ```

    #### Checkout data

    The payment function payload needs to be an object with detailed information about the customer, currency and cart. Below you find details abou each needed field:
