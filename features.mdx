Tonder is the ultimate payment solution, but we have more than one option within our platform that will allow you to more efficiently manage the accounts of your different payment methods in one place with <b> real time data and reporting </b>, to be able to recover sales or even sell through social media thanks to the <b>payment links</b> and also be able to increase your sales thanks to the <b>routing</b> of transactions so that if a processor rejects your client's card, we can try another to recover the sale. In turn, to optimize the operation of your business, you will be able to make <b>refunds</b>, review your <b>payouts</b> and make <b>reconciliations</b> without leaving the Tonder platform with all the <b>connections</b> that we have available for you.

### Real time data and reporting

You will be able to track all your sales even if you have more than one payment method for credit and debit cards. 

In the dashboard you will see the principal information of your business and sales, like total sales, refunds, transactions and how your payment methods are working.

In adition the information that you have in the platform you can export it to a csv file for data analytics. In addition, month over month the Tonder team will send you a report with relevant insides about your business operation.

### Payment links

If you can sell it, you can send it, with the payment links there are no limits for your sales, and you will be able to reach all the channels that your customers use when they’re shopping. This will increase your sales and also, all the payment links have your routing workflow!

### Routing

One of our favorites, the routing will increase your sales when a PSP didn’t accept your customer card for soft reasons (see more about soft and hard declines) the tonder system will try with the next proccesor in your account, so you don’t lost that sale and the client won’t need to try multiple times with the same card. For better undestading this is how it works:
