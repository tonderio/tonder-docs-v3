## The 3DS Payment Flow

The steps below breakdown the 3DS flow to better demonstrate how it works.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialization and Configuration">
    The process starts setting up the environment. Initialize Tonder's SDK, adding the necessary data:
    - `returnUrl`: The URL to which the user is redirected after the checkout process, regardless of success or failure.
    - `apiKey`: The API key used for authentication and authorization.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Display the Checkout">
    Display the payment form to the user. Here the user will add their payment details and start the payment process.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Processing the Payment">
    When the user clicks the payment button, the payment process will return a status defining the next step:

    - **Pending**: The user is automatically redirected to the 3DS authentication page.
    - **Success**: The payment is successfully processed, and the user is notified.
    - **Failed/Declined**: The payment process is halted, and the user is informed of the failure or decline.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verifying 3DS Transaction">
    The status of the 3DS transaction after the user has been redirected back to the return URL is validated.    Depending on the response status, appropriate actions are taken:
    
    - **Success**: The transaction proceeds normally.
    - **Failed**: The user is notified, and necessary steps are taken to handle the failed transaction.
  </Step>
</Steps>
